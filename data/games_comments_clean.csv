LIKE: Fun to push your luck and fun to buy more ingredients.

DISLIKE: Very random. The bags were very thin and shuffling the tokens in the bags was difficult. Stiffer bags would help in this case. Too easy to cheat when drawing.

OVERALL: Too random for me, to the point I felt there were no worthwhile turns. Wasn't enjoyable, although we didn't play with all the correct rules (like the rat tail). I probably shouldn't be so harsh, but I felt the scoring was too lopsided and perhaps a different scoring mechanism to allow some hidden scoring for the end (the ticket cards in Ticket To Ride, for example).

aeroguru1978,7.0,"A fun little push-your-luck bag builder.  Kids seem to really like this one, and the mechanics are simple.  You blind draw 'magical ingredients' from a bag to fill a cauldron, with a goal of not pulling too many charry bombs (the values of which, if they exceed seven, will cause the potion to explode).  Good for teaching probability concepts, though kids can never seem to resist pulling 'just one more' ingredient several more times until their cauldron explodes.  

Lots of variety out of the box, with the ability to use different sets of books to alter the effects of other in game ingredients (for example, one set might encourage the collection of a larger amount of pumpkins, normally the lowest value ingredient, to maximize the impact of a later drawn toadstool).  

Because it is blind drawing, while you can try to maximize probabilities in your favor, sometimes you are just going to get a bad draw and there isn't much you can do about it (there are minor mitigating options, such as earning rubies to refill a flask that allows a cherry bomb to be returned to the bag when drawn if that bomb didn't cause the cauldron to explode; or in certain variations mandrakes, if drawn at the appropriate time, can also remove cherry bombs).  But, given that it isn't a grand strategy game and it plays quickly, this really isn't that big of a deal.

Afrochiapet,7.0,"A colorful and light push-your-luck game that has been a good table ice-breaker. Players throw random components together from their growing bag of ingredients to brew the best potion. It's a fun experience to tempt the fates which each pull from your grab bag, either furthering your point total or blowing up in your face.

The game mechanics are built so that every player has a fighting chance to remain in the game despite any misfortune. Additionally, the variations for the different ingredients add some incentive for replays. Quacks is not my preferred style of game, but I find it an easy sell for those wanting a low stress experience. It is silly fun that is hard to get overly competitive or mad about.

Their video says the pieces are ""bakelite-style"" pieces, which brings to mind the geekup bits. But these are lighter in the hand, and there are little sharp nubs out the side where the sprue was attached. Not dangerous-sharp, just not-satisfying-to-hold-sharp. Also, the player bags are massive. They take up so much space on the table, we were not sure what to do with them.

I don't love massive decks of unique cards as a main mechanic that every hot new game seems to have these days.  I'd play it again for sure, but it's a little long and a little more luck-based/tactical than I prefer.

Cons:

- It feels like you are just collecting points and it doesn't require too much thought (definitely more tactical than strategic). I know many games you are essentially just collecting points, but generally there will be mechanics that make it less obvious and/or more fun.

- I haven't tried all of the aliens yet, but the 3/5 that I did were meh...I feel you could ignore them easily. Edit: have now played all the aliens. Opinion is the same.

This game would benefit from having more of an engine and to make the aliens more interesting. Perhaps an expansion could improve this, especially the engine part or some mechanic to make things feel less ""point grabby"".",4,40,160,14,8.38008,690,6872,en

alzsara,8.0,"It has lots of things I love in a game - inviting theme, navigating an ever-changing board, lots of cards to lean into, tight resources, a wealth of options on how to go about things. It boils down to two major thrusts – launch probes and travel out to planets for VPs and effects, or ‘scan’ to win area majorities in space sectors for VPs and effects. Twice midway through the game it stops while you learn new alien rules (new ways to earn VPs and cards) but it's a two-edged sword - thematically immersive to discover aliens, sure, but learning new rules mid-game breaks immersion (euro, euro, euro, break for narrative, back to euro). Your strategy (and cards) drives how fast to push for tech advances and in what order. This should be enough to differentiate your games. It has the Terraforming Mars model of a round being as long as it takes to spend all your resources but nearly all your turns affect other players on the map so there’s no ‘just play out’, even though you’ve got your next 4 turns planned. And turns get longer as the game goes on due to the high number of free actions available as you collect more cards and energy – it was 3+ hours for 4p. Having said all that, it was good to have all these options and I’m keen to play again - I can live with the downsides given the upsides are so good.",4,40,160,14,8.38008,690,6872,en

My first play with my wife, I went the launching probe route and she went with capturing noise. What a mistake from her, she only completed 1 section of the area majority because I totally ignore that part and completing the whole section is too hard for only one person.

Edit 3/8/25:
We played the scanning action wrong (smh). Each time we scanned in our first game we only did that action using only one tech instead of the whole row of techs. To be fair the player aid is not very specific on what to do on that actions but is obviously our fault. Bumping back to a 9.5!

anim8r,9.3,"CGE’s Alchemists and Codenames are a couple of rare 10-rated games for me. However, most of their releases since then have been “okay” at best, including Lost Ruins of Arnak, which I didn’t care much for (I know I am in the minority for this). I’m also not into space-themed games, so I wasn’t expecting to enjoy SETI. But it turned out to be one of the few games of the year that lived up to the hype.
The actions are simple, but the gameplay offers plenty of options and strategies to explore. The cards force some tough decisions that can totally change your strategy, which I love. The variable aliens that appear in each game add a nice touch, differentiating each play and creating a thematically relevant mystery and drama around the reveal.

The production is top-notch. Everything is well-designed and organized, with nice components, a clear and precise UI, and fantastic player aids. The game seems easy to get into because of the care taken to ensure that there are no weird rules or production choices that hinder gameplay.

I’m especially glad that the game while set in outer space space, is NOT all black. I’ve never understood why most space-themed games resort to such a lazy approach. This visual team got the art direction of the game just right!
Pain Points:After two plays, I’ve got almost no complaints—which is rare for me! However, I would love to see more aliens, more public goals, and other features to further shake up the game and make each play unique.

The various ways to get points feel arbitrary and the mechanisms are not particularly evocative of the theme. Gameplay is mainly a race to claim various scoring locations on the board, a little bit of area control, fulfillment of personal scoring objectives. Pure action efficiency with a little engine building. The one bit of novelty is that part of the board rotates during gameplay - but because the rotation is hard to predict, it doesn't lend itself to any real strategy, it just feels like a random luck generator.

Update: Now i play this game 3 times. In summary, we have here a good and thematic game. I love the rotation of the solar system as well as the adaptation of aliens. However, for more replayability, I would like to have asymmetric start conditions as by Arnak the expedition leaders. New aliens would also be cool.
I am courious to play this game with more than 2 players.

update 2: The best game experience is by 3 players. More interaction through are control aspect.

Update 3: After 10 games (2 and 3 Players), i understand why some people say, we don't need the 5 round. At this point and experience, the game offers nothing new in the last round. You just score more points. Maybe the publisher should think about adding an experience play mode in 4 rounds.  I also have to admit a new aspect in this game would be fine if a new expansion came.

Played this game in 4 Rounds. Even my wife said this game was more interesting. I hope to play this game with the fan-made expansion with the asymmetric start condition (see Forum) and the new aliens (Heptapods) soon.",4,40,160,14,8.38008,690,6872,en
azeem,8.0,"SETI is heavier than I am comfortable with, but thankfully the clear manual and relatively straightforward ruleset made the game easy to pick up.  Players only take one ""action"" on their turn, but there are a plethora of free actions that it is necessary to say when one's turn is done.

This is the game I hoped Terraforming Mars would be.  SETI is a card-driven game with a space theme, and the theme is extremely pervasive, especially to fans of astronomy.  The game truly only has 4 resources (energy, credits, cards in hand, and publicity), with a little bit of substitution between them.  Like in Terraforming Mars, cards cost credits, but are more efficient than ""standard"" actions.  However, cards in SETI can also be discarded for a resource as a free action, and occasionally tucked away for income.  Like in Race for the Galaxy, SETI gives me the constant puzzle of how to play out my hand, an element I found woefully missing from Terraforming Mars.

SETI features a number of race elements on the planet board, on the scanning sectors, and on the alien boards.  However the game itself lasts a fixed number of rounds, rather than having a player-triggered end.  This fits perfectly and ensures the game does not go on longer than it needs to.

The three-ringed solar system board is a wonderful optimal path problem, and players can be handsomely rewarded for correctly predicting when the rings will rotate (e.g. preparing for when Neptune is at its closest!).  The cutouts in the rings are the real chef's kiss--simple, but impactful.  Indeed, they are a microcosm of the game overall.

The limited engine building in SETI comes from tucking cards for income and gaining technology upgrades.  Players had different opinions and which techs were the strongest, which I hope is an indication these are well balanced.

Concerns I have for SETI are that the aliens might favour certain paths to victory over others, and these are only revealed partway through the game.  If a player had already been going down that path, they will do better if that alien enters their game.
Separately, I can also imagine a ""bad"" starting hand that does not give a clear path forward.

Because there are so many race elements, player interaction is inherent.  However, there are a few incidental interactions such as the rotations of the solar system rings and the cards in the face-up market.  It seems all scoring avenues rely on these, so maybe it hurts all players equally?  Nevertheless, player interaction is certainly there--much more so than in other games of this scope, like Ark Nova.

SETI is an incredibly impressive design, but unfortunately its weight still felt excessive.  I was hoping SETI could stand alongside games such as Le Havre or Sidereal Confluence, which I find heavy, but worth the weight.

The liberal use of free actions involves micro-optimizations, and this causes me a lot of analysis paralysis.  Not calculating leads me to make mistakes and have less fun.

An odd parallel I can draw is to Res Arcana.  Players draft cards which synergize and race each other on a pool of available point-getters.  There are no free actions, but players really only do one thing each turn.  Res Arcana is a smaller game that evokes many of the same feelings as SETI, theme notwithstanding.",4,40,160,14,8.38008,690,6872,en

Bayushi Sezaru,8.0,"SETI is the Spiel 2024 release from CGE, and it draws a lot of attention, both for its publisher and its table presence.

The game has a theme I personally love (and I find it pretty thematic): launching probes and signals to contact alien life forms is pretty exciting.

Mechanically, the game uses a pretty wide array of actions, combined with an interesting system to emulate the rotation of the planets around the sun.

The game has a very tight economy, with resources that are definitely scarce in the early game, but not abundant in the rest of the game either.

Cards seem to be the main driver of divergent strategies, giving players different incentives and ways to circumvent the tightness in some of the resources. I like how the designer made the cards multiuse, inserting another inflection point of decision in every move.

Another great feature is the unknown nature of the alien species included in each game, altering slightly the rules and strategies available.

Potential problems are the unpredictability of the solar system rotation (since the ”cilcks“ are player driven), and a bit of downtime (since turns can be quite thinky and even combotastic).

SETI is anyway one of the most interesting gamers games of 2024, and one I would like to try various times. The rating is 7.5 for now, but if it will stand the test of repeated plays, it could likely go up a notch…",4,40,160,14,8.38008,690,6872,en
bazyliszek10000,8.0,"The atmosphere is slightly noticeable. However, it is an economic game, where we calculate resources, etc. The shifting circles introduce additional randomness and interfere with planning. However, they are very atmospheric. The aliens are a bit forced, the game could simply end earlier. Yes, new rules are added halfway through the game, it can get tiring, someone may also like it, so it is not a big flaw, more of a grumble. The game is good, as good as many other good euro games on the market. I would gladly play it, but I do not have to have it. It is not a very outstanding title.

Played the solitaire mode on the first and second level (needs to test those on higher levels) and it does feel that you keep doing over and over again sometimes the same kind of action but that is how the solo mode and the deck for it are structured. Still willing to challenge myself with it.
In 4 player between explanations and play through we did hit the 4 hrs mark ( that is the usual time that we get while playing other boardgames anyway so it is not that uncommon - looking at you Terraforming Mars ). One thing that me and my play group noticed is the lack of ""variates"" on the strategy to follow on the long run, everybody gets the same amount of resources at the start and the only thing that could make a difference is the first revenue card and the cards in hands dictate much of the first rounds. 
It would be nice to have some ""corporations"" or ""prelude"" like in Terraforming that give you an agenda or something specific to work for but that is just an opinion.

bnordeng,,"This is a big game that felt like one of the better Euro games I've played in a while. Here are a lot of options for what you can do. There's a lot of cards that are cycled through and used for different things, such as paying for them to take an action or putting them in your tableau, or discarding them for an immediate benefit. The unique interaction with the extra terrestrials that are discovered as surprises felt like a nice twist on this big Euro. It creates new and different rules and scoring that is likely significant to who wins the game. And it feels like players will generally have enough time to react and make something of it, though that won't always be the case.

I've seen complaints about the game being slow and I think if it's played with a number other than 3 players, that's probably not good. Also, players cannot be AP prone, but I'm not sure there are many big Euros where an AP prone player won't be a problem.",4,40,160,14,8.38008,690,6872,en

garry_rice,6.0,"Players are crafting their own cosmos and seeking to be the best at doing so:)  Players begin their turn by using up to 3 movement points to move their own and any neutral tokens to set up what they earn for the crafting phase.  There are four different areas with a player earning the basic income for each token (even opponents) based on where they are located and also the bonus income for where their token is located.

In the crafting phase, players place the items earned in the income phase to try and score their nebulas (based on a specific combo of different colored stars) as well as set up life forms around planets to try and score advanced life tokens (when a scored nebula has been completely surrounded by life tokens the player earns the next available advanced life token).  There are also other ways to score with a time track and goal cards that are applied at various times throughout the game.

One type of income is movement points, which allow players to move stars and lifeforms around and re-use them - just note that you do lose one star anytime you score a nebula. This is stronger than it may first appear - especially later in the game.

We played a two player game and first of all the game looks amazing on the table. I *love* the stars!! The rotating marbles are a very interesting mechanic. I haven’t seen something like this in a game before. It reminds me of a rondel but getting rewards from all the spaces each turn is super satisfying. 

I love games where you get a lot of stuff! I like it that I don’t have to want for people to take their turns as well. Once they move their marbles and collect their stuff, I can start my turns while they take their time building their own board. I don’t like being rushed on my turns so this works very well for my playstyle. 

Some of the components are a little small, so some people with big hands may have an issue, but it was not really a problem for me.

[b]Comments:[/b] [thing=424785][/thing] is a strategy game about mancala, set collection and tile placement. The ideia is that players will move pieces around, gathering resources, with the goal of scoring nebulae, placing life, drawing cards, upgrade actions, and more. Players earn points by completing the demands of nebulae, plus open universal goals and the green track. Once the game ends, the person with the most points will be the winner!

[thing=424785][/thing] was enjoyable. I liked the mancala aspect and how easy-going the game is: whatever way the stones end, you will have a lot to gain and do: is only a matter of having a focus in order to achieve more precisely what you want or need. While the theme makes sense, [thing=424785][/thing] isn't really thematic, but sure looks pretty. There isn't much in term of interaction - as each person have their own corner of the cosmos to deal with - and only the dispute for the open goals and how the stones end up which may matter from one player to the next. In the end, is was a fine experience, and one I wouldn't mind having more.",4,60,90,14,6.57381,24,248,en

Move, remove a token will be 90% of your game.
-Replayability really poor for us once you you know the faction because No real scaling during the game or change. Playing with 12 card become boring really fast.
- Pointless at 4 player because you will play 1/4 of the actions played. Play it at 2 players you will play more often. 
- If you have luck with the dice may be you have a chance to win tand avoid unnecessary damage

filix2704,9.0,"This is the most beautiful game in my collection (prettier than Root imo). The map looks beautiful, meeples look beautiful, the cards look beautiful, the box looks beautiful, you get the point. 
I really love the theme of the game - woodland animals setting aside their differences to defeat a common enemy - the machines. And boy let me tell you, the fight feels hopeless. The entire game you feel like for every step towards victory you take, the machines take two. You clear a factory? Machines build a new one. You defeat countless mechs and accumulate damage? The machines spread pollution. You clean pollution? Machines spawn more mechs. 
The game tells a beautiful story of struggle against seemingly undefeatable threat. And many times, it is. The game is ridiculously hard, and most of my games end in loss. Most. Sometimes, luck hits just right and we are able to win, many times moments before disaster, and that feeling is just so great, it makes all the losses worth it. Failing however feels a bit sad every time, I can't imagine playing with more difficult machine cards, game already feels too difficult.

Despite how hard the game is, I love it for what it is, what it says, how it looks and what emotions it expresses each time I play it. One of my favourites in my collection.",4,60,120,14,7.37092,188,1895,en

KRWoods1,8.0,"I like this!  It has an interesting feel that sets it apart from other cooperative games.  That said, it is far from perfect.  The rules leave lots of questions unanswered and timing questions arise from the start.  Also, it is so very easy to forget to resolve a machine card after each player's turn, which can obviously mess with the difficulty.  I suspect most of those issues will be resolved with a good FAQ and repeat plays, though.  Also,, the box is pretty small!

Once you get through that, the game is quite interesting.  I love some of the details, such as how the Engines have a side indicating which direction they consider left and right, which helps when the piece's facing changes.  I love the way each faction feels different without the need for lots of special rules.  I love the way everything you need to do (breaching walls, clearing pollution, destroying mechs) also helps your ultimate goal of building your campsites, meaning that you never really feel like you're wasting a turn just cleaning things up.  The game has lots to explore and try, and it does so with relatively simple rules.

BearDot25,4.0,"I really wanted to like this game, but my first couple plays were not fun. The rules and goal of the game are incredibly opaque and abstracted yet mired in confusing thematic terminology; we were constantly forgetting things and messing things up because of how unintuitive and exception-laden everything is. The player aids are surprisingly lacking (it could really use a step by step guide to each phase; I used the BGG user generated player aid 10x more than the provided one) and I think the rulebook could do a much better job taking a beat to zoom out, drop the jargon, and explain how everything fits together mechanically. There are many downstream implications of your actions (reputation, the pace of the week, the gossip phase, the multiple end game scoring possibilities) which are difficult to keep in your head and form a coherent strategy. I won my second game and had no idea how + was almost doing things at random by the end b/c it didn’t feel like what I did mattered all that much compared to what the game did.

In general I never felt like I was having fun or was able to formulate interesting plays I could rely on -- it feels like you are at the whim of the cards/dice for the most important aspects of the game (rolling the right die for timing the action you need, the community card flip during festivities, which gossip doesn’t get flipped at week end, rolling the dice for indictments, etc.). Maybe after 4-5 plays I will see the forest through the trees more and be able to work things to my favor, but I would never want to teach this and don’t think the mechanisms of the game are fun enough to warrant that level of investment.

carol81,9.0,"Final update: Queer people are used to blurry lines. Some people say “there are only two genders” but then we trans and queer people appear and things gets a lot blurrier, same as a platypus, a very queer animal, exist just to made blurry what it seems perfectly clear in a “basic” way. Basic biology, you know. Platypus are not basic, and neither are trans people. 
And this review is by far the queerest thing I have ever done in my life, to be a queer person commenting on the queerest game and blurrying again the lines of what can be done or not, because I cant technically post in any bgg forum yet maybe Im doing it and replying to what is being saying so what Im really doing? For me this is the queerest performance you will never see again on bgg. Just a serendipity inside another serendipity, a true dancing ball of a party where everything that seemed impossible suddenly it is not, an even a platypus can be a mammal laying eggs. That is true queer magic for all yours to enjoy. It maybe even deserve their own promo card named carol81,  but Im just dreaming out loud here

Then again as every queer person knows the longer you stay the higher chance to be hanged, so I prefer to left this as the final update, as a recollection of the queerest performance ever happened on bgg and no to push it any longer.

As a final funny comment somebody asked me about tseuquest, that is the only other game in my collection with a comment from me (some people have looked my profile me quite thoroughly) and they asked me if they have some relationship. I didnt realized previously, but tseuquest is also a very queer game. It changed its name after being conceived, it was a game, vaporware than a game again. Nobody expected to finally being a reality and however here it is, like a weird platypus. And it is also a game with a lot of quirks and extravangances so you either love it or hate it. Queer 100% even if that was never the plan to begin with, but that is like everything queer is, never planned on advanced but always strikingly perfect.

Going serious again: About the bi people, I apologize again, I understand what you are saying (Im also bi and I know how much bifobia there is even in our community, so much that even bi people like me can say still say stupid biphobic things) so please keep reading for a further explanation 6 paragraph below (yeah I talk a lot, Im a girl you know, Im also queer and a geek, so this is also my final update because I also need to focus in real writing (like 31st march is almost here and plenty other things) and stop writing here. Art have to be finished somewhere, and this performance end today. Thanks everybody for reading, writing me, contacting me, helping me, whatever. Im maybe the main actor, but this bgg queer performance could have not been possible without you. 




Update after publication: Im very happy this comment was finally published and will try if possible to answer any possible question. Here is a bit more detailed things like the queen and 3 equals cards is because you have equal things in common to get a new friendship and the jack and not needing suit is because when you have a chance to get sex you are not too scropolous about the suit this card is really are. 

Going to an actual question, somebody said ""Having a full hand is the only way to get rid of threats without getting exposed as cards above a hand size of 6 can be discarded without exposure (of course they will still generate gossip). Does this seem like a theme break for you then or can you see a thematic reason for it?""

And the answer is that they are still exponsing themselves by discarding threat cards to the gossip. They only feel a bit safer because they dont get exposed directly, but only at the end of the week when due the threats they discarded some house are going to get some suspicious and sooner and later they will be raid and then if they have reputation on that colour, they are going to be indicited. So they are not avoiding anything, but just delaying it. In fact it can be argued that a person this way, who have a full hands of molly things that they would like to do but instead making reality in a party they prefer to lie low, keep getting new thoughts and discarding old thoughts and threats is like a person in the closet. Having plenty of things they would like to do, but worrying too much about threats or potential exposures. And that person is not exposed during the round, but the gossip is unavoidable, because people have eyes and they see their behaviour is maybe not hetero enough, maybe they are still single being 40 years old, not really interested on getting married, and people talk. And if you dont support  your community, sooner or later your house will be raided and you will convicted for having a couple of cards of that colour, and you will lose for end of time after 5 rounds or whatever without getting enough joy. So I agree with the question that discarding and keeping low seems like a way to avoid exposure, and it works in real life, but only at short term. If you think long term you need to risk yourself or you will lose to the time, and to a life not fully realised (I think that is a problem molly and hetero people face together)

Other person said about christening about a drag queen naming themselves and I agree enterily, that is why this kind of thing is in the yellow deck, the femminity one. Using other name, other pronoums, joking about having a kid, a husband, etc.

There have been another person that have tried to put words on my mouth that I didn’t say, like that hetero people cant enjoy this game or understand it. If that were the case I wouldn’t have try to write all this long thematic explanation in order for them to be able to undertand better the game. Of course they can play the game and enjoy it, but the game is enriched by having queer insights and experiences, and that is what I try to provide here for them to get a more rich experience. Then again this is just me being mansplained for a men that cant undertand how a trans women review have attracted a lot more comment and interest that their own sacred male thoughts so he tried to mansplained what I did wrong, why I should have not done what I did, why he is really speaking for the community and etc etc. trying to focus all the thread on them because you know the spotlight is only for them to shine, not what a woman have to said about something. Honestly everything is quite boring and that have happened a lot in the past. The only positive thing I get on those interactions is that same as some persons are not longer comfortable with me around a wargame anymore, being mansplained only show that Im read, seen and interacted as any other woman, and Im happy for that

In a final post a person have asked about the single out of bisexuals people and then I feel I need to apologize. Im bi myself, but I see the bifobia that person was referring and I apologize for that. When I talk about rogues I was referring to a particular kind of man, that is attracted to trans woman, sometime they say they are bi (hence my comment, but I apologize because indeed is not the most important characterist, nor universal) but basically they are chaser, they loved us by fetish and not for what we are as human beings. And we know a chaser is a chaser, not a real love, but sometimes there is nothing else to have a date with. And sometimes you get a good time, and even a very “mad” admirer, but at the end this kind of things usually end badly. And most importantly if/when the chaser/rogue is rejected then all hell can break lose. Maybe gay people don’t know what Im talking about, but I guess other trans girl we know what Im talking about and they will agree with me. So playing with rogues/chasers is like hot deal. Very easy at start because they are completely devout of us, we are angel, goddess, whatever, but very bitter at the end when they feel rejected so they become a real threat. So I apologize again for using the term bisexual ehen I should have used the word chaser, who describe a lot better what I was trying to tell. I have also update the description below













Hello, Im a latino trans woman and recently I played to Molly House. I liked a lot and in fact I was pleasantly surprised as it was a lot more queer and trans than I ever suspected when I backed it. I thought the game was more about gay communities, but not as they said queer and trans communities were there from the very beginning and it is clearly showed in the game.

However the game is quite cryptic, like a true thing of our own, so you need to be “in the know” (be part of the lgbt community, living similar experience to that what is being portrayed in the game) in order to fully understand it, appreciate it and enjoy it. So the reason of this post is to open out the theme of the game, let you know what the different parts really are, in order for hetero/ally people to understand what is really happening in the game so they can get a full story from it. In any case I think this game greatly improve with at least one trans/queer people at the table, so they can correctly interpret what is really happening and/or tell a personal anecdote of how some of the game happenings are similar to real life events of their life and that kind of things. At the end I think games like this should be facilitators to talk about real issues that happen in our lifes, but if everybody is hetero at the table and/or nobody knows about a real queer/trans person there is little to talk about.

Enough with the introduction, lets go to the game. First of all our hand of cards. Our hand of cards represents our bravery and freedom of mind to be gay, how confortable we are acting gay in a society that prosecute us. How much you care about what they will say and also the need of release that you have. When you have not gone to a “party” in many time or have been represing yourself most of the time, the higher probability you end doing something reckless or even utterly stupid, even forgetting your own safety. That is the reason when you have six cards on hands you feel capable to be brave enough to get the most of the party but also having six cards is more probable you have a threat that need to play or you will be exposed just for having too many cards. When you go to a party and get joyness, your hand of card is reduced because you have got satisfaction recently so the need to release is diminished. And if you only have one card you are not brave enough to even throw a party yourself, and if you go to a party with only one or two card you most probably will be the timid queer that have not enough self confidence yet to really be themselves and mostly just look how the others get fun and score their cards while they only trade their two cards for a different two cards when they go to gossip. Then again when you cruise, you are just testing your limits, doing a gay thing, like for example wearing this “gay t shirt” in public and nobody saying anything to you, and that kind of thing empower you to try even “bravest” things so you increase your hand of cards. Then of course at the end people remember you weared that “gay tshirt” to the beach that day (or made that “gay” comment or sang that song or cross dressed for Halloween or …), so this is permanently in your reputation and you can be accused for that in the future. Talking about that suits also have theme: 

Blue is alcohol/drinking (you do weird things when you are drunk and/or tend to drink a lot for no apparent reason, trying to forget/erase that you are queer) 

Red is sex/erotic (you grab a male butt “as a joke” or do a gay comment again as a joke or you get excited for something you should not and you thing others not noticed it but yes, and it gets permanently on your reputation) 

Green is gay party (same as with blue sometimes you tend to party “too hard”, or you get fun doing things no entirely appropriate for a men in a party, maybe dancing/moving  too much, maybe not trying to hit the girls at all, is hard to define but when you are in a party and try to be yourself for some reason instead “hetero party” you “gay party” (whatever that means) because is just the way you have fun when you party)

Yellow is femminity/doing queer things (you don’t know why but you enjoy using female manarism, or using female pronouns, or cross-dressing or exploring be yourself in different ways) 

When you use the cards in cruise you are just testing your limits, exploring what you really are or what you are confortable with, so they increase your hand of cards but don’t get you any points and then when you use cards in a party you are really trying to be yourself, to get fun even being queer/trans and that is what the game is about. 

Regarding that the level of success of the party are those:

Dancing ball: Everything flows together perfectly, like a straight flush, and you feel in completely connection with who you are, enjoying the party and the life just as you are. Unfortunately even today this is not a easy task, so unless several persons get lucky getting the needed cards and they collaborate creating the right environment thisis not going to happen for XVIII century characters ever. As I said even for many XXI queer/trans characters this is a fleeting moment, not something to be enjoyed 24/7 sadly

Queen: This means a new “girl” joining our community/doing a new friend like us. It is a queen (the girl) and three equal cards meaning the things we have on common with this new girl so we are able to start a friendship with her.  We are not in completely connection with ourselves yet (dancing ball) but we get a new friend that is like us, and that is also very comforting, to do not be alone, to have somebody to share the way we are and that understand us, etc

Joker: This mean getting some sex action (maybe just a few kisses, maybe more) with that handsome joker in the party. That is easier to get because men are not too scrupulous when they can get sex so they don’t care too much about suits, just play your cards a bit intelligently and you will get lucky tonight. That is still a good outcome to the party, although worse than the previous ones.

And if you don’t feel in connection with yourself, get a new friend or have some fun with that handsome stranger then this party clearly sucks and it is boring.

When you play a queen or joker in your reputation you are making yourself a “public” queen/trans person or a public joker which intend to get laid with the queens (although in the party sometimes the joker get with another joker, party is very confusing and fun, hehe) and that is the reason for the bonus when you made yourself even more “public” by testing your limits publicly (cruising) or being the heart of the party

The Rogues are “curious” people outside the community. Maybe they are exploring their sexuality, maybe they are gay in denial, maybe they are just looking for a fetish, maybe they happen to be there just for playing the violin. Most of the time they are what is call chasers. That makes them very exciting (they can be any value) because they are the new kid of the party. And if “the new kid” is chosen and get fun themselves then everything is ok, but if the new kid is not chosen then is going to make a fuss and some person are going to be accused (just because he don’t get laid, that is the real and only reason, but he is very mainly and hetero, yeah) 

Also a final consideration. In this game hetero people have a hand size of zero. What I mean is that if “our hand of cards represents our bravery and freedom of mind to be gay, how comfortable we are acting gay in a society that prosecute us” then hetero people, logically, have zero desire to be gay and they are not comfortable around being gay in a society that prosecute lgbt people. And that is the reason the reformation of manners prosecute us, because they cant imagine what is having a hand of card or wanting to play it. That is the reason I written all the above because if you have never been dealed a card (because you are hetero) then you don’t know what this game is about. Believe me when I say that gay teenagers have hands in their cards. And they can try to lie low, doing nothing except getting more and more cards, more ideas they would like to do and play. And even if they don’t play anything they can still be exposed by having too many cards and a constable in one of them, because when you have many ideas but don’t realize then sometimes you do reckless, stupid things that expose you without giving you nothing in return.


Regarding treachery, this have been critized and I understand the reasons. Personally I prefer to get hanged than to treach any fellow lgbt person. And being hanged is not to lose, is just dying younger, but at least you tried. To be yourself and die at 30 can be better than negate yourself and die at 70. But then again that is easy to say when being hanged for being lgbt no longer happen in my country (although still happen in another countries). So I also understood that in death or life matters sometimes we crumble and nobody cant judge on that. But for a game you can bet I would never betray my community. I prefer to lose the game than my dignity. And I guess this is true for many lgbt players so I guess hetero players who have not problem in betray in order to win the game have some advantage over us. And if you think about it this is fair, because in real life they also have this kind of advantage over us so maybe this is the final tip of the simulation.

As a final conclusion the more I think, the more I realise this is a game about playing the cards you have been dealt. Some of us draw from the molly deck and others from the hetero deck, but the final point is to play the cards are you dealt and try to get the most fun (and if posible dont get hanged for it). Or just try to lie low, dont play anything, pass to any possible party or chance where you can really be yourself and live long and resentful for not be able to draw from the hetero deck. A great metaphor, thanks a lot Jo





I would love to post all the above in a thread on the forum, but I cant because I was permanently banned of any post just for saying that women don’t play wargames because some men don’t want to lose against a woman, so they actively try to make us uncomfortable on those space so we cant get skilled enough to be able to win them. I guess men have temporary bans and several warning before a permanent ban, but as latino woman I was permanently banned just for my first trespassing. I guess I got a major indictment from bgg just for saying what I thought and what I had experienced, but this is what happen to molly people sometimes. I tried to appeal but I was dismissed. In any case I would like to ask any of you who can post if they will be able to copy this whole document and post in a thread (including this last paragraph) in that case I would be very grateful to them, in order to more people to be able to see it, although maybe it get you some minor o major indictment, who knows? But then again to be able to play molly house in real life should be considered as a bonus, isn’t? 

Update 5 days later: I posted this comment 5 days ago because I wanted to share my understanding of the game and because I thought the game was a bit too cryptic for non lgbt people, as other persons have post in other comments. However I naively thought that some person will quickly copy it and will post in a thread as I requested. 5 days later a few persons have commented about it or have written me saying they liked it but nobody have dared to post it in the forum, not even when I said that they can left the final part away and this have gave me a big insight on you cis people. You are too afraid of punishment to do what you feel is right. On the other hand Im quite happy with what I did to be punished. The OP of the thread thanked me privately for expressing my views and experience, because it helped them to better understands the reasons of no women in wargames, other person tipped me with 5 GG, and my comments had several thumbs before being deleted. So even if I think I was ultimately punished too harshly for just saying what I thought, without attacking anyone, Im happy of what I dared to say, because it was the truth and helped other persons. Then when some time passed a moderator asked me that I should stop using this account and use a new one, in order to be “free” of the punishment. But this would be akin to say that this never happened, to erase the past instead accepting it and try to fix or healing it. But I digress. What I try to say is that maybe we trans people are not currently targeted just for being trans or being different, but because they know we are brave enough to do what we think is right (like living as ourselves) without fear of the consequences. Because we know that being untrue to ourselves, to do not do right things for fear of punishment is a worse consequence than any punishment we could receive, like being hanged in those molly house. And honestly if all of you are too fearful of whatever consequence of reposting this comment on the forum can be, is no wonder that Trump is doing whatever he want in your country. And you are too fearful to do anything, because even a fear of a minor sanction in bgg is just enough to make you renounce to whatever you will want to do. Im not that way. And I guess that is the reason I cant post in the bgg forum and you can. However who is really more free?

Very solid interesting game, and the theme does a lot to bring it to life. The gameplay compliments the theme well, and I actually find it pretty easy to play and teach, especially compared to other Wehrlegig Games. 

At lower player counts it's not so interesting, given the drama is there, but it's against necessary automas which makes it feel a little impersonal, in a game which needs people to engage with very personal aspects. However, it functionally works.

I'm openly queer, as well, so naturally I'm into stuff focusing on the history of my people in specific locales, but that's not ""the game"" alone. While it's not the best game when it pulls together, despite the gameplay largely matching the theme and the intention of the design, it is reliably interesting. However, I'd love it if it was more severe...which I think is where the design does let itself down at points? It can be too gamey. But I'm a miserable history honesty person. I think a more coherent and potentially miserly end game may make non-queers a lot more understanding of both the rules, and what sets up a potential endgame. Flipping your marker to the noose side should weigh more heavily on the players in all forms, and it's just not all the way there.

Still, great fun.

Also, this is not really the game and more a suggestion given the responses from both fans and none fans of Molly House. I do not believe you have to play this deathly seriously or with glib recognition of the death of targeted populations. There's a slight pretension we find ourselves in where ""serious"" replaces the meaning, and value, of a design and experience. And indeed, life.

If nothing else, this game, much like a lot of greater underground queer art, will focus on counterculture enjoyment. What's outrageous or what's cutthroat, what's silly and what's offensive to conservative values. What's in this game is risk mitigation, and what's more fun than risking it for a good, necessary time? Nothing. Because that's what plenty of people have to do to enjoy life in times of struggle, fear, or worse.

Play it not as an exercise in remembering the dead for being dead (regardless of cause), but for remembering the background of ""joy"" during life. Enjoy yourselves, stop believing the rules are hard to get your head around (they're really not in the context of the whole experience), and play it with people willing to dick around and have a laugh when someone plays a bad hand for whatever reason. It's honestly the most fun I've found with this experience. With that in mind, don't play with people who will flip a table after taking the session too seriously, as this game is all about those bad hands.

In that regard, Molly House is a perfect lighter compatriot to John Company 2nd Edition. That game is as ridiculous, glib, and harshly funny as Molly House, contextualised once again by a window in time.",5,45,90,14,7.52549,122,940,en

greatwolffenris,10.0,"First Impressions:

It's a complex thematic masterpiece. 

In many games the theme serves to help you understand the mechanics.

In Molly House the mechanics serve to help you understand the themes.

The rules are not especially complicated, but they are a bit fiddly, with weird special cases that are quite confusing on first play. It's not a game that's going to reveal it's depths to you on the first play.  It definitely didn't for me.

I can see why the rules are the way they are. After my first play I'm fascinated by the structure it creates for invoking emotion through game play.

Semi-cooperative hidden identity games have always had a big appeal to me. Battlestar Galactica was the game that really drew me into modern gaming.

Molly House may be the pinnacle of that genre, a hidden identity game about the real world implications of having to keep your true identity hidden. 

As a parting thought I'll leave you with this.

The choice to inform, is not a binary one that irrevocably condemns you or the community. There is even a path to victory by joy through betrayal.

10/10 because I know high art when I see it.

Was snortingly amusing . We didn't try informing, but I think that's a cool mechanic. I was surprised at how easily the community can score points too. There's a lot of events in the endgame including our score leader and then 2nd place getting indicted and hanged!  Good lord. I think a few more plays would make it quite enjoyable.

HeyImBode,10.0,"An uncompromising game on every front for me. The usual feelings of Awe I get from John Company and Pax Pamir are there here too. Incredibly coherent narrative range on display, addictive gameplay that feels like I'm playing a classic card game or a trick-taking type game. Since the game is built on a cascade of reveals, it remains varied and interesting what player position you'll be put in. Deeply deeply social and Playful in nature. I absolutely love how co-operating in this game still has players debate within the teamwork. I absolutely love that none of the hidden traitor mechanics are prescribed. 

And since it can wrap up under 2 hours with very little setup, it will be the most easily tabled game from Wehrlegig for me.

If I had to come up with a few cons, it takes a little while to fully absorb why cards go to one zone or another. Most negative reactions on 1st play I've seen are attributable to this aspect. So the game requires some special attention on the teach. The game is also heavily focused on narrative and that might hurt the enjoyment of those looking for a fair contest. In spite of that, the game is still skill expressive so that's not a con for me.",5,45,90,14,7.52549,122,940,en

KRWoods1,4.0,"I wanted to love this game.  The theme is unique and really opens the doors to a world I never knew about.  There was definite love in the crafting of the game and the effort to bring the details of this part of history into the rules.  However, I cannot let my enthusiasm for the theme overlook the significant issues the game has.  

First of all, the rules are all over the place - there are lots of special terms, different discard piles to manage, and other concepts that make the game difficult to teach and learn.  Nothing feels intuitive.  The roll-and-move mechanism feels unnecessary and not fun.  The card play is not that interesting and involves too much randomness.  The solo variant is also kind of monstrous, expecting you to manage 5 hands of cards.  

However, the biggest issue I have is the end-game.  If the ""good"" ending occurs, players are literally eliminated by a die roll - this is frustrating and could result in someone winning not because they played well, but because others were unlucky.  I wish there were rules to make the indictment cards matter but not result in high-roll elimination at the finish line.  I found that sucked a lot of the fun out of the game and kind of negated any aspect of skill the game encouraged.  

I think some people will enjoy the theme here, but the real problem is that the game itself is not really very much fun.  It feels like moving things around with no real control.  For a game that tries to be about joy, this is sadly quite joyless.",5,45,90,14,7.52549,122,940,en

100pcBlade,8.0,"The more I play this, the more I'm beginning to appreciate what a good game it is. There is nothing new or innovative and, in fact, it's the archetypal ""the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts"" game. And the theme blends superbly well. it looks a bit overwhelming but is surprisingly easy to teach because the core rules are relatively straightforward with most of the complexity coming from individual cards; lots of variability because all those cards (more than 200 of them) are all unique and different map boards are available; and there is a nice learning curve to ‘playing well’.

On the other hand, it doesn’t really have anything new to offer, it leans heavily on Terraforming Mars with its tableau building of cards, it can be very ‘multi-player solitaire’ because it’s easy to ignore what the other players are doing. And it can run a little long (although to be fair, it doesn’t ‘feel’ long). Not as good as the BGG ranking suggests but it is growing on me",4,90,150,14,8.5349,1063,15271,en

However, after playing it, I can see why it is so well loved. I find the game exceedingly addictive. After the first play, they game dwelled in my mind and I played another the next, and the next, and the next day. The variability is effective at keeping it fresh and each play feels a bit different than the last.

I can see that it may become stale (like any game can) at some point, but that seems far off after a half dozen plays. I've found that some games just don't flow well, and others, everything is perfect. I think this contributed to my play, not the game design, but something to keep my eye on.

update: I don't like the game end where everyone else gets a turn after the person who ends the game. There is unnecessary strategy there that doesn't benefit the person who ends the game. It's as if you are in a race, but you know that you have to stop at the finish line but everyone else gets more time to pass you. I'd prefer equal turns for sure.",4,90,150,14,8.5349,1063,15271,en

35tango,8.5,"*NOTE* This review currently only has 2 plays with only 2 players.  I do realize this game is probably plays much better with 3 or 4 people.  I can also accept that I might just be terrible at this type of game.

This game is close to being great to me, but the outcomes of my games has left a sour taste in my mouth.  Learning the game took 4 hours with the assistance of videos.  I feel like the manual and quick reference material leaves much to be desired.  The iconography kind of sucks too.

With all of that said, this game is fun, and interesting, and even the art kind of has a fun, nostalgic, genuine zoo vibe.  The tactical nature of designing your zoo and trying to reactively achieve the most objectives is fun.  
  
My biggest issue with this game, is how swingy the end of the game can be.  You can spend an entire game working toward staying close in appeal and conservation, only to get completely blown out on the last turn.  My first game by 25 points and my second game by 40 points.  It left me feeling terrible.  I almost always lose at games, and am totally fine with that.  This is the first time where I felt like I was defeated by the game as much as I was by my opponent.

UPDATE: Upon subsequent plays, I've come to the conclusion that I just suck at this type of game.  It is not fundamentally flawed as I had believed.  Ark Nova is a good game that I enjoy playing in spite of the fact that I suck at it.",4,90,150,14,8.5349,1063,15271,en
4Corners,8.5,"Thematic, baroque game about building your own zoo (which appeals to me), using an innovative (to me) card action selection mechanism, and an interesting and rarely used endgame/scoring mechanic (only saw this in one other games, Rajas of the Ganges).

The goal of the game is have the highest score at the end, and this is calculated by determining the difference between your conservation points (usually harder to get) from your appeal points (sort of like the more conventional victory points), which each go around separate tracks and the game end is triggered once those two markers pass each other (again, this was used effectively as it is here, in Rajas of the Ganges).  

On your turn, you select 1 action card from a set of 5, with the twist being once you activate a card, it goes down to level/strength/power of 1, and if you wait/delay, it can eventually go up to a level/strength/power of 5, which is obviously preferred but not always the best choice at the time.  The actions are: 1) build- you spend money to place different polyomino zoo tiles on your player mat, following the rules that tiles have to be adjacent to each other and cannot be built on the water and rock obstacles, and you get one time bonuses for covering up certain spaces, 2) animals- you can play animal cards out of your hand, and this is a major way to score appeal points, but you have to spend money and meet conditions, similar to Terraforming Mars, but with even more restrictions, also you must have a place/building for them to occupy in your zoo, 3) cards- this allows you to draw more cards into your hand, and in addition to animal cards, there are also conservation and sponsor cards, all of which can be situationally useful, but with such a huge deck of cards it both increases variability as well as the luck factor, 4) sponsor- you play a sponsor card from your hand which typically gives you an ongoing ability and/or a onetime bonus (provided you meet the requirements) and this also means you must lay a sponsor building in your zoo (which has pluses and minuses to doing so), 5) association- this is kind of a side game, where you start with one ""worker"" (with the potential to unlock up to 3 more) that you can place on a sideboard to get different bonuses such as affiliations with universities, affiliations with other countries, making donations to conservation projects (very important but hard to do), and acquiring academic knowledge (?), which moves you up yet another track for better card selection options.  Of course for almost all of these things, you get nice one time bonuses the more you/unlock.  The other nice twist is that each action card has an upgraded side, which is much better and necessary to do some actions, and while there are 5 cards, there is a maximum of only 4 upgrade possibilities, making for some interesting choices.

Each player is also dealt an endgame scoring card which will grant endgame conservation points if they play to it, and there are always a few standard conservation projects for everyone to vie for (although players can additionally put their own into play).  

The game is very thematic (everything ""makes sense""), it has interesting choices, lots of variability, and has some nice mechanics that are very underutilized in other games.  The graphic design and component quality is rather mediocre, especially considering the publisher and price point.  The game length borders on unacceptable; even played casually, as a 2er, while I enjoy it, it's quite long even at that.  Also, with the game being so dependent on a large deck of (mostly unique) cards, luck of the draw can play a significant factor.  Overall, a very strong design, particularly impressive/amazing that it's from a first time designer.

abhiroo,6.0,"I've cooled on Ark Nova a bit after 100-odd plays (mostly on BGA), but this is still a solid medium-to-heavy game that scratches all those Euro itches in a very digestible format and an interesting theme, although I'd argue that the choices you're making in this game aren't all that different to those in 'smaller' engine-builders with fewer moving parts.

The game suffers on a tabletop - having to keep track of your tableau's icons and powers (and your opponents') is arduous and leads to protracted turns. And as you grind out more plays, the theme does tend to blur into the background as it condenses into yet-another-set-collection Euro, where you just scramble for the icons you need, but perhaps that's criticism you could level at any Euro.

Having played this so many times now, I've seen enough plays where the luck of the draw of the map and initial hand gives players a huge head-start, incredibly important in a game like this where starting well is half the game, and the catch-up mechanisms are far too sparse to make a significant difference.

Ark Nova might just be another iteration of (mostly) multiplayer solitaire, but when everything clicks just right to give you that perfect end-game cavalcade of points, it feels immensely enjoyable and satisfying in a way few other games of this genre can match.",4,90,150,14,8.5349,1063,15271,en

The # of turns/game end mechanics also creates some unfun point counting situations, where the optimal play is to get 1 point from victory and then let someone else end the game - which doesn't really feel fun. Effects that grant extra turns/actions also lead to weird end game incentives, which has the same problem.

When my partner and I bought this game we were skeptical given that it's very complex, still we took our time (around a week) to read, play during breaks and more. By the end of the week we finally got to play one match almost non stop, it took us around four hours which is the longest we've played.

Even after all this ""struggling"" I can say it's such a wonderful game, it has so many different strategies and mechanisms, for hardcore players and maybe even casual gamers who want a hard game, it's excellent, it even comes with organizers

My only complaint is if there was a way to make it shorter plus to have overlays to hold everything but thank god is not so slippery or messy as terraforming mars (which people compare this game to and is not close cause ark nova is actually good and has actual good quality)

Apr. 2022: First play rating. Very similar to Terraforming Mars, but faster. We got through a 3p game in just a dash above 2 hours, which feels pretty good. Has the same 'tactical' nature of figuring out strong combos and building out engines, although the engines are a little less extreme. Also very much a race, akin to both Viticulture and TfM.

acolyte,7.0,"Ark Nova is interesting, and the core of the game is fun, but I can't understand why it is so highly ranked and regarded. No way is it game of the year. Sure it has a lot of re-playability, and the core gameplay and theme are pretty good.  But the 3+ hour play time just kills it! This game is a bear to learn and teach, which is a shame because the basics are so simple. Played with a friend where we both learned the rules before hand, and even then a 2P game took 3.5 hours, which is ridiculous. Played solo once knowing the game well and it still took 1.5 - 2 hours.

The core game of building enclosures and playing animals into them is great. I also like the combination of conservation + zoo appeal to win, and all the different track rewards. Plenty of really great concepts. 

But the Conservation and Appeal Tracks should have been much shorter. The rest should have been stripped away or drastically simplified down. Especially that association board and all the association and sponsor actions and cards. It's like you learn the core game, and then you have to learn another game's worth of rules on top of it. Not to mention all the symbology; symbols are great, but cut more mechanisms out so there are not so many. In the very least, these things should have been an expansion or module. I wish there was a way to strip them out. As is, it's just too complex, too long, too much down time to be worth it. It's sad, because I really wanted to love this. The core of the game is so good, but it needed to be further developed down to make it more accessible, with options to add complexity.

NOTE: I did see a designer/publisher supported variant where you have all players start at 10 on the appeal/income track to cut down on time a bit. This is essential. (I would also consider starting at 1 on the Conservation track.) I wish they were default 20% shorter, with an option for longer games. I plan to try the game one more time with this variant, and focus more on speed to see if this addresses the problems. Otherwise, I can't say I want to play it more.",4,90,150,14,8.5349,1063,15271,en

adamredwoods,5.0,"2 plays / 4 players

LIKE: I enjoyed the action selection, using power based on where the card was. This added a fun rotation management for the cards. I also enjoyed talking about the different cards, the effort involved in getting an animal was enough to add charm to the zoo being created. I also enjoyed the coffee-break mechanism forcing players to hurry to play cards to not be forced to discard-- although this aspect disappeared later in the game.

DISLIKE: For 8 hours-- the entire first 4-player game-- I was looking up and explaining rules to others which took more total time than my actual turns. The rules had to be searched for in 3 to 4 areas: rulebook, glossary, errata, and BGG forums. Sometimes a rules was only explained in a small area in the rulebook, hidden by a wall of vast text (for example, animal release for a reptile house was covered in ONE example, yet not in the main rules as written.) Other issues I feel that detract from the game, is that the game is largely about what you can do with the random cards in hand, and if that path is not apparent, the slow, incremental actions in a turn adds to frustration. This minor issue can be remedied with a few plays, but should be noted for first-time players. Above all else, the game feels multi-player solitaire, which for such a long game is not for me. In our second play, we kept missing bonuses, which was annoying due to the small information on cards to keep track of.

OVERALL: For me, I had a poor first play experience, it was a slow grind of interpreting rules and heads-down play. Second play was better, but I still have my reservations. Convoluted rules on random cards is just not fun for me. I feel the basis of any game is the accessibility to its rules, because scattered or fragmented rules leads to more time spent looking details up, explaining, and sometimes deliberating with other players. Ark Nova falls into this category. I could see additional plays, or an all-encompassing card glossary, creating a better playing experience, but I have 100+ other games that immediately offer better, faster experiences. 

I do feel I owe the game another try with 2 or 3 players may give the rating a small bump.

This game doesn't sell much to me if it's mostly random card mitigation accompanied by multi-player puzzle solving. Why is this rated so highly on BGG? From what I sense, it is a good solo and couples game, and those tend to rate higher on BGG. To further criticize, the board game community continues to drive game designers to make multi-player solitaire games with vague rule-breaking cards. Does this make a good game? Remind me why we are getting together to play a game again? To read tiny cards and rules all night? Bleh. I'm a snob, but I do play some of these game, I just do not need more of the same.

Similar games: Terraforming Mars, which I don't hold in high regards either. Wingspan, which also has a lot of vague cards, but it's okay. Underwater Cities, which I enjoy a lot, due to the easy to understand cards. Dune Imperium is my favorite from this type of lot.",4,90,150,14,8.5349,1063,15271,en

[b]Enjoyment - 17/20[/b] – This is a game that by all accounts I should love. It has great mechanics, a fantastic theme and artwork with loads of reliability… but this game is held back heavily by its play time and complexity. I really enjoy playing this game, the few times I’ve played it, but it seems like such a hassle to get off the shelf and play that it doesn’t really feel worth the effort on most occasions.

[b]Replayability - 14/15[/b] – This game has 212 different zoo cards… with this fact alone you’ll never play the same game twice, but on top of that the final scoring cards and different zoo maps will make for a different experience very time.

[b]Game Mechanics - 13/15[/b] – I really enjoy all the zoo mechanics this game has to offer, and it really feels like the mechanics fit the theme very well. I also think the conservation track and VP track is a neat idea, but there isn’t anything incredibly unique or memorable to push this above a 13.

[b]Theme/Artwork - 15/15[/b] – The theme of this game is incredible, and coupled with the mechanics and beautiful card art it really feels like you’re a zoo owner trying to create the best zoo around. I think it might be the most beautiful and thematic Euro I’ve ever played. Well deserving of a perfect score. 

[b]Gameflow/Pace - 5/10[/b] – Although the game is very enjoyable while you’re playing it and it can be fun to craft how you’re going to build your zoo, turns take A REALLY long time, and it’s easy to lose focus in this game. The game can be played with up to 4 players, and the BGG community has decided that it’s not playable at 4 players due principally due to game length per player.

[b]Flexibility - 6/10[/b] – The game can be played from 1-4 players, but like mentioned above, it’s not great with 4 players, it’s really best 1-2 players and good with 3 players. 

[b]Production - 5/5[/b] – I love all the pieces in this game, especially the cards, great production value.

[b]Effort To Play - 3/5[/b] – This game takes a while to set up and tear down, it’s not the worst I’ve seen, but is definitely a factor to keep in mind when playing this game. 

[b]Accessibility - 2/5[/b] – Not only is the game difficult to find the correct player count, or get off the shelf, but it’s also a pretty complex game to teach/learn for the first time. It’s especially hard because it’s difficult to have a “learning” game that takes 4+ hours.

[b]Total Score: 80/100[/b]

But that's the only similarity. The main feature is the action selection cards - quite clever and yet straight forward. Many options, frustrations and thrills in combos and the theme is quite strongly felt. I find the scoring system quite odd - the winner will finish in the positive low points and others in the (perhaps distant) negative points - this after a few hours of play albeit very engaging.

But it’s not as hard to play from behind as in TM. I also felt like it was missing the clever bits, I personally didn’t see any really good combos.

The real problem here is there isn't a lot of card draw. In every round of TM you can draw into new cards that you decide to keep, as well as draw during the round. This gives you the capability to change course. And Prelude gives you the ability to keep a monster card early because you can get away from behind them. Ark Nova doesn't have these capabilities and that is why it's mired in the 7s for me. A strong expansion could fix it.

Yeah I just couldn’t get this above a 7, even tho I’ve won 3 out of 4 games. Here’s hoping an expansion improves it for me.

AdelinDumitru,10.0,"Splendid is the first word that we thought of when we set out to write the review for Ark Nova. It does almost everything right, and even in those areas in which it is perfectible it offers something exciting and nuanced. 
The central action selection mechanism is simple, yet so, so fulfilling. On your turn, you select 1 of the 5 always-available action cards, its strength being determined by its position on the row. You can gain new cards from the central deck (animals, sponsors or conservation projects), you can build enclosures, kiosks or pavilions on your board, you can place animals into your zoo, you can send workers to establish partnerships with international zoos or universities, to promote your zoo in order to increase its reputation, or to endorse conservation projects, or you can play Sponsors card (basically technology cards). But that’s not all, as each of these cards can be upgraded – and, since you won’t be able to upgrade all of them in a single game, choosing which one to upgrade becomes a fascinating enterprise on its own. 
There are no predetermined rounds in Ark Nova, gameplay being lightning-fast –when a break is eventually triggered, gaining income and resetting some of the markets can be done really quickly, further contributing to a satisfying gaming experience. In fact, triggering a break is one of the main sources of interaction in this game, as it can lead to players losing access to some cards, or even speed up the end of the game if certain player board bonuses had been unlocked.
The end-game trigger itself is a thing of beauty, and has to do with the confluence of a player’s 2 scoring markers: one that concerns the appeal of the zoo (which is increased by accommodating animals) and one that concerns your conservation efforts (and you’re being rewarded for placing vulnerable species into your zoo, and for a variety of conservation efforts, from hosting a specific combination or animals or for returning them to the wilderness). Your score is going to be the difference between the appeal points and the conservation points that you obtained, and timing it perfectly is going to be the key to success.

adi_venturer,9.0,"One of my few favorite Euro games, a genre I typically am not the biggest fan of. A few things that make this game a 9 for me:

1. I love the theme! Who hasn't wanted to build and manage a zoo as a kid? The mechanics of the game do tie back to the theme to a good extent too - something that is really hard to achieve for a Euro game.

2. The game rewards short-term tactics over long-term strategy because of the giant deck of cards. I love this! Most Euros lock you into your chosen strategy early game and then your best bet to win is to just stick with the strategy you picked and hope for the best. Ark Nova allows you to change and evolve your strategy as the game goes on, so you don't feel like you're stuck with the starting choices you made for 4 hours. This means that a player new to the game could beat someone who has played the game many times if they are able to adapt to their cards better. 

3. The game has a sprinkling of a lot of popular Euro mechanics - action selection, worker placement, polyominos, resource management, tableau building, hand management etc. but no single mechanic is the core mechanic of the game. They all come together beautifully to give you a little bit of everything. 

4. The game is intuitive/easy (albeit long) to teach and easy to get to the table (thanks to the included trays). Also, unlike most Euros, it is relatively easy to keep track of who is in the lead, what they're building towards, and what it takes to score. There is no seemingly random score sheet to fill at the end to tell you who the winner is.

[b]Marine Worlds:[/b] I have mixed feelings about the expansion. It tries to streamline the game, but I think it makes it a bit more convoluted and increases the things you have to keep track of in the process: new action card abilities, new animal abilities, new mechanics etc. Specifically, I like the addition of new marine animals - mostly my personal bias as I love aquatic animals. A common complaint with the base game is the size of the deck and that's what the expansion tries to address - and it succeeds in doing so by cycling through the deck much faster. But the deck size never bothered me in the first place so I could take or leave this change. The action card upgrades make the game a bit more asymmetric. The game becomes lighter on its theme with the new additions though, e.g. aquarium animals not having water symbols doesn't make thematic sense, so that made the game a bit more convoluted for me. All in all, I'm not buying the expansion and I think I prefer the base game over it, but will play with the expansion with my friends who have a copy.

I must admit that I like the idea of conservation, but zoo's are a means of entertainment for us and don't give much regard to the animals. As such, this game was not one that appealed to me in theme.

The game has gotten a lot of praise and some criticism. While I don't understand the heaps of praise, I'm not going to get every game, so it's fine. The criticisms are not uncommon in games with these mechanisms, so you either like it or don't.

Mechanically, it uses the scoring from Rajas of the Ganges, the card play of Terraforming mars, and a few other mechanisms from great games of the last 5 years. There's no problem with that either, because most games are built on top of previous design ideas.

What's fun about the game, in my opinion, is how it accelerates. You start off barely able to play an animal and an enclosure, but by the end you can have tons of money to play multiple animals, enclosures, etc. So you can have really exciting turns and the growth is fun.

We all found that there was a disparity between upgrading cards and unlocking assistants. There are more opportunities to get assistants than the number of assistants you have. This is not the case for card upgrades, so when you get to 2 conservation, always take the card upgrade. And when you upgrade a card, it's important to make good decisions. Getting a level 2 association card is necessary at some point.  I would advise against getting level 2 sponsorship.

The game can feel very swingy and luck based to to the card draw element. If you like that in a 3+ hour game, then have at it. For me, I didn't think it was that enjoyable. And if you don't get cards that match the conservation goals, then you're in big trouble. In my opinion, that's not fun. Someone's going to have a great time, someone else is going to be struggling the entire game. This may be of no fault of your own...

Ultimately, the game is for the audience it is for. It's like wingspan meets TM. If that appeals to you, you'll really love it. If you like a more strategic game that's less luck driven and maybe takes a little less time, I'd suggest maybe try before you buy.

Update 7/23:
On a second play I enjoyed it more and am bumping it to an 8. I think it's a good game and I like the feeling of conflict in what upgrades to get and what path to go. But I will admit that I think part of the reason I enjoyed it more was because I had cards that worked together pretty well and felt more in control.

agentpatman,10.0,"I can see what the hype is about. I feel like they got everything right. The theme is excellent and blends well with the mechanics. The action selection mechanism is perfect for this game. It really focuses your turn because some options are not available to you so you don’t have to think about it. The more often you use it the less powerful it is. It forces you to execute different actions so you are always maxing the abilities of the cards. Knowing when to play your cards to pull off all the bonuses is excellent. 

The appeal and conservation tracks are a nice touch. You have to strike a balance between the two which forces you to juggle building an attractive park but also paying back in a way which is excellent thematically. 

The huge deck is amazing. I think we saw 1/3 in our play. There’s so much to uncover here which makes replay ability insane. Different park maps add another layer to this. The game is definitely tactical and card draws can add a luck element like any card game. 

The only complaint I have is I wish there were fun facts or info about the animals on the cards like wingspan. Hopefully they come out with an app or website to type in the card number to do the same thing. Maybe a printed booklet when they are done with expansions.

Alan How,10.0,"This is an incredible game. Very polished, great presentation and superb gameplay.

You are building rocket ships to take guests on a tour of space. You need to assemble the rocket, provide power, food and oxygen, advertise for guests and by doing so you will score a bunch of points.

The worker placement solution to getting these resources is very elegant. There are 6 spots to place your worker each of which contain two of the twelve actions. You take two of these and often from the adjacent spots. 

Since everyone has 2 starting workers there is competition for these spots. But the beauty of bumping someone else’s worker back to their base is they get a minor benefit and you get to take the action. Everyone has their own player board to monitor progress and this is made very easy to see at a glance.

There are special agenda cards to acquire, which have two options, a reputation track that can get you out of trouble for loss of your reputation and many other aspects to consider. All of this may seem too much but an excellent player handbook guide provides many of the answers even with a “ How do I get this resource?” support. 

The variety is astounding. There are 48 blueprint guest elements to put in your ship; three types of guest, a bunch of cockpit and engine choices, a big deck of agenda cards as well as two expansions if this isn’t enough variety. 

The game is very smooth. All the actions are intuitive and match the theme so you quickly gather this set of information in your head and a second game will be so easy to play, with focus on the options and routes you wish to follow.

Amazingly, this is from a first time set of designers and a first time publisher. They hired GameTrayz and Ian O’Toole so it all fits together well and looks great, but the design is brilliant.

cbazler,8.0,"A good worker placement game with a fun, novel theme. It's quite challenging, since you basically need a bit of everything and constantly find yourself being wiped of all of your resources as you build and launch your ships. 

There's a nice give-and-take: launching a ship gives you income from passengers but temporarily deprives you of a worker. Building your segments depletes your money but you can make some back by recruiting passengers. The ""token-flipping"" income mechanic is genius, and I like the incentives you get from replenishing the agenda cards. I don't think the game scales well with two players, however: even with the dummy player you don't bump each other often and some parts of the board (e.g. ""Refill Storage Silo"") are rarely used.

As always, I dislike Ian O'Toole's art and graphic design: the whole appearance is lifeless and drab and looks like all of Lacerda's dry big-box games (though this game is lighter than those). The icon-heavy board and insistence on complete language-independence make it unnecessarily hard to learn and teach.

It's a beautiful and wonderfully produced game, and I think if you enjoy Vital Lacerda's Kanban, you'll enjoy Galactic Cruise, but it doesn't quite fire on all cylinders for me.

Both Galactic Cruise and Kanban are what I refer to as very procedural or assembly-line games -- you do A, then B, then C, etc. to get to your goal. You can do things in a slightly different order, or focus more on one area over another, but ultimately you still need all the same parts to make the whole. That in no way means it's easy. Galactic Cruise proves itself as a modern tight euro in which at numerous points in the game you'll be just $1 or one resource short of accomplishing an amazing turn. That always peaks my brain ... ""find a more efficient way next time!""

So that's good. But even after a few rounds I felt like I was on rinse and repeat -- get a ship, get blueprints for cabins, schedule a trip, attract some customers, get some money, get some resources and launch. The one aspect of the game that added the most variability were the agenda cards. Most of the cards are pretty powerful, and can help you do those assembly-line steps in unique ways. That's fun, but beyond that there wasn't a lot of variability in the actions you take.

There is some minor interaction in the game with a bump out reward in the worker-placement spots, but it doesn't feel that consequential. It's not like by bumping you out I'm hurting your plan or altering the game in any big way. In other words, there's no decision angst with a bump out -- you do it with no harm to you and the other player if that's where you want to go.

It's a good thing it also emulates those games' actual quality, as well. It feels very much inspired by The Gallerist in particular, as a pseudo-worker placement with a heavy emphasis on action efficiency. In Lacerda fashion, the process of sending people on cruises is somewhat complicated, but fortunately the individual requirements are straightforward both to comprehend and to actually carry out.  I appreciate that this is a much more ""player-friendly"" game than say, On Mars. Not in the sense that there's no player interaction, but that the game itself is less hell-bent on forcing them to make inefficient choices for the sake of progressing their convoluted mission.",4,90,150,14,8.44125,285,2707,en

fireshrine,8.0,"After much anticipation, Galactic Cruise has finally arrived in Australia. As a Eurogame enthusiast, this game has been on my radar since its Kickstarter launch just over a year ago. When I first saw it, I actually mistook it for a Vital Lacerda title—especially with Ian O’Toole’s signature artwork all over it. But who exactly are Kinson Key Games? I’d never heard of these designers before. They seemingly emerged out of nowhere with a game that boasts a winning formula and top-tier artwork.

At its core, Galactic Cruise is a worker placement Eurogame with resource management and point-salad mechanics, wrapped in a unique theme centered around selling space flights. The mechanics are relatively straightforward, but the sheer number of decision points ensures players are constantly engaged in optimizing their strategies. What I enjoy most is the high level of positive player interaction and the interconnected systems. I generally avoid solitaire-style Euros (Ark Nova, no thanks).

The game’s components are top-notch, and the Game Trayz inserts are exceptionally well-designed, making setup and teardown effortless. Our first three-player game took a while but was highly competitive—I can see this game truly shining at higher player counts. My favorite Euro of 2024 was Inventions: Evolution of Ideas, but Galactic Cruise is already shaping up to be my 2025 Eurogame of the Year (unless Speakeasy arrives before the year ends).

One final highlight is the game’s impressive replayability. With two included expansions and variable setup elements—such as randomized worker placement locations and company goals—each playthrough feels fresh. If you’re a fan of Lacerda-style Euros, I highly recommend Galactic Cruise.",4,90,150,14,8.44125,285,2707,en

The closest comparison might be Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, or co-designer Mori's earlier Caesar game. Toy Battle sheds the card phase to battles that Confrontation has, and sees you placing pieces on turns instead of moving them. But the push & pull of the different win conditions, the rock-paper-scissors dynamics of the tile values vs. their minor abilities, and the minor but useful quirks to the maps themselves all lend a similar atmosphere to the proceedings.

Very simple, streamlined abstract-y chess-like-but-simpler-and-with-randomness 2er capture-the-flag game. Each player has an identical deck of pieces; draw 3/4 to start the game (player 1/2). There are several (7?) different types of piece which give you some bonus effect when played onto the board (e.g., draw more pieces, play another piece, etc.). The board shows each players HQ on their side, connected by a set of paths and nodes to the enemy HQ. You can play a piece onto an empty node or on top of a weaker piece, as long as you are just one node away from your HQ or another of your pieces. If your pieces surround a region (occupy every node around it), collect the VP tokens set there during setup. You win by capturing the enemy HQ, or by collecting enough (12?) VP.

[b]Comments:[/b] [thing=434654][/thing] is an abstract strategy game about area influence, area movement, zone control and hand management. The ideia is that players will use their units in order to control areas of the board, either to reach the enemy HQ and place a unit there; or to get enough medals, due to control, as any of these will give the win! Units must be connected to a supply line from their own HQ in order to be placed (with one exception) and they can be placed above the units of the opponent if the one above has a higher value. On each turn, the players choose to either place a unit or draw two units - if a player can't draw more units nor place a unit, the game also ends, and this player loses.

[thing=434654][/thing] is alright. I don't particularly enjoy much 2p competitive games, but I don't mind much the ones with a bit of randomness which are also quick, and [thing=434654][/thing] fills both marks: there is luck in the draw of units (but each player have the same, some might just appear sooner than others) and play is very straightforward - a single and fast action: place a unit or draw 2. There is, of course, thought behind the choices, as the effects of the units are deterministic - there is no random element in activating or placing a unit. Overall, I wouldn't mind playing [thing=434654][/thing] some more times, but, due to my tastes, wouldn't add to my collection nor really ask for it.",2,15,15,8,6.89476,56,328,en

Ahmadauurggh,9.5,"I had high expectations of CTG in this IP and the game did deliver. The first three session campaign (and one other session 1) was a lot of fun. The game has exceptional components, a pure joy to deal with. Character building is tightly integrated into the gameplay. Tactical combats are varied. Story parts could have a bit more meaningful choices to my taste, but seems to be good for casual games. 3 session mini campaign mode is fun, but I still wish there'd be a ""single shot session"" not dependent on the campaign, but I guess you can just play the 1. session as such, no prob. Components are of superb quality and as great as the price tag on the game would imply.

About playtime:
Playtime is high when playing for the first time. The first two sessions were 7 hours for 3 players and 5 hours for two players. They included a lot of time spent in reading skill lines and class abilities, choosing overland movement and overall learning the game. Expecting to be significantly quicker when all players are experienced.

Second session in Morrowind with Undaunted was a whopping 12 hours (with at least 7 battle/delve encounters). My warm recommendation is to have a loose house rule of taking at least 30-40% peaceful encounters of all encounters during a session, otherwise the playtime is just way too high. Another strong recommendation: In certain quest lines, if there is no instant penalty for failing a part of the quest and if it significantly saves time, let it fail and move forward. Especially if the quest line is heavy in delves because they take the most time of all encounter types.

All in all, Botse is pure pleasure to play as long as you won't run out of real life stamina while playing and the game would be taking long.",4,120,240,14,9.1874,189,1709,en

It took me about a Week between playing the Tutorial and following the ""Dized"" App and reading the rulebook to finish my first campaign which, of course, i lost in the final Battle.(solo, two handed)
I was ready to pack it away but I wanted to make the effort to learn it to be worthwhile, so i started a second one wich I lost again, these time already at the end of session 1.  I discovered then that I been doing a few rules wrong to my detriment
 so i decided to keep going.
And know i started a 3rd campaign and finally I am enjoying it a lot. I hasn't leave my gaming Table since 3 weeks.

I like the character development with the push and pull of skill lines in BOTSE. I like the fatigue and dice cooldown mechanic in BOTSE. I like the lockpicking better in BOTSE. However, the characters do feel flat compared to TMB. The sessions take way too long. The players tend to be overrun with loot that isn’t interesting for their particular build but necessary for hoarding/discarding for quests and other things.

bazyliszek10000,9.0,"There is no point in writing about the execution. It is impossible not to refer to TMB in the opinion. Compared to TMB, the battle map is larger, especially towards the end of the scenario. Is it good or bad? TMB is definitely different in this respect, it is more tactical, every move, or lack thereof, matters, here it is more like in other adventure games. The map is generated randomly, every time we move on. This introduces a lot of variety, but as above it is not as countable and thought out as the fights in TMB. The combat mechanics themselves resemble TMB, but we do not have, for example, an initiative track anymore. Enemies also have simpler behavior, which makes the fight and decisions smoother, but also shallower. It seems to me that some of the mechanics that influenced how tactical the game TMB is, were cut and simplified in favor of the atmosphere, map diversity, etc. When it comes to character creation, we have complete freedom here. On the one hand, we develop our character as we want. On the other hand, the characters are not as diverse. Each character in TMB forced different tactics, behaviors, strategies, etc. Here, you can theoretically create an individual character. The Elder Scrolls is no longer as fast a game as TMB, you have to prepare a map, enemies, draw cards, in addition to adventure cards like in TMB, we will also get random cards defining subsequent rooms and their rules, etc. Will this push TMB out of my collection? Certainly not. When playing TMB, I am not particularly interested in a lengthy campaign, I have other games for that. TMB gives me fast character development, with a light touch of card adventure and tactical fights. The Elder Scrolls, on the other hand, is a very interesting combination of TMB with a ""dungeon crawler"", it also has its place, especially when I have more time and the desire to play a single scenario, instead of a lengthy campaign (where I often have a problem returning after some time, because I feel like I have lost the plot). The Elder Scrolls competes more for a place in the collection with other ""dungeon crawlers"" than with TMB.",4,120,240,14,9.1874,189,1709,en
bbritt33,10.0,"CTG magnum opus. TL;DR the long game play is more than worth it, but it is more of the same if you already don't like CTG. 

Is this the best game ever? No. Is this game the best CTG has put out? IMO, a resounding yes. The devs took Too Many Bones and Hoplo (my personal preference in their lines) and cooked up a masterpiece. The battle system is slightly more streamlined, but still the typical battle system from CTG other titles. The story goes way more in depth and is more evolving than Hoplo, but still not over bearing. And the devs definitely listened to the criticisms of character skill building in TMB and created an incredibly fun system to develop a personalized character (this is where the game really shines).  

While the battle system has been more streamlined for TES BOTSE and is still fun, it somewhat feels redundant after their other titles. Dungeons and Delves do change this up slightly, but most of what's encountered are the clashes where it's just the same system. 

Typically I take off in my ratings for a game not being accessible. And I almost didn't buy this game because of the time commitment. I can't with this one. While it takes a long time to play (I take about 2-4 hours per arc depending), you don't notice the time as it feels epic. That being said, it is an expensive game. Is it worth the price? That's up to you, as I wouldn't call this an absolute must have.

If you already like CTG, you will love this game. If you don't like CTG, I'd argue this won't change your opinion. ",4,120,240,14,9.1874,189,1709,en

The vast amount of loot which has stayed true to the IP is also amazing. The production quality is also unsurpassed by any other publisher.

Going from 9 to 10...this is the only thing I'm interested in playing now. Maybe it isn't perfect...but maybe it is :)

1/16/25
One full campaign completed, and all I want to do is start another one. This has all the elements that I enjoyed in Too Many Bones while making lots of improvements. The cooldown and fatigue system is great, and it is very nice to get your special dice back (definitely funner in that way than TMB). I much prefer the character building here...the freedom is great and there is a lot to discover (although I am wondering if there will come a time when I feel that there aren't enough skill lines to enjoy endlessly). The maps and movement is a huge improvement over TMB, which feels more abstract with its 4x4 grid and movement cost. It seems people are complaining about the rule book, but I think it is good, and the Dized tutorial was sufficient to get me off the ground with minimal reading. For the most part, the game play is simple and after a single campaign things are flowing very nicely for me. On the negative side, some of the dice icons are difficult to read or differentiate, which is a pity as this can dampen the dice-roll dopamine rush as you try to figure out what you've rolled. Finally, I much prefer the world of Elder Scrolls to TMB, whose artwork always creeped me out.
Oh, and the production value is through the roof...Chip Theory knows how to make a luxury game.",4,120,240,14,9.1874,189,1709,en
bolty2142,6.0,"First Impressions (Subject to Change)
TL;DR: I'd rather play TMB as it’s easier to get to the table and offers more variety in gearlocs, items, and enemies.

As a long-time fan who owns and has played all of CTG’s games, with TMB being my favorite, my perspective comes from a place of excitement. However, after a few sessions, I didn’t experience the same excitement I get from TMB—instead of wanting to play again, I found myself wanting to share my thoughts, which isn’t ideal.

While I would like to rate this game higher, after over three years of development and multiple delays, many of the game’s flaws feel inexcusable.

Pros:
Excellent component quality.
The character creation system is a nice touch.

Cons:
The rulebook is a mess—it’s actually worse than TMB's rulebook, which is saying a lot.
The enemies feel very generic, with the exception of the quest-specific enemies.
While there are many items, they lack excitement and can feel unnecessary, making the game feel bloated.
The skills are interesting, but it’s difficult to find the right dice to match each skill.
Setup and teardown are cumbersome, and the amount of table space required—despite the mat and player books—is excessive considering how little space you actually interact with.
The delve mats are very generic. It might have been better to simply use books for these.
The jailbreak scenario at the beginning is an instant skip for me as the achievement system  forcing to pick a class I didn't want to pick or losing everything obtained feels forced.

Final Thoughts:
Ultimately, I might end up selling this game. The space it takes up doesn’t seem worth it compared to how often I’d be willing to pull it out, especially when TMB offers a more satisfying experience. But I will update this if I get more plays in.",4,120,240,14,9.1874,189,1709,en

CONS
- Table Space.
The rulebook recommends (p. 12) a Table Size of AT LEAST 3' x 4' (90cm x 120cm). HA! Good one! My first table was a card table with a homemade extender, about 5' long and 2.5' wide. The playmat spilled over every edge of my table! Because of BotSE, I actually purchased a Foldable ALPHA gaming table (I can't have a permanent setup) that is a glorious 6' long by 4' wide! It still takes work to find a good place for a dice tray during a delve, but any smaller table would have a hard time with Delves and Dungeons especially. This is the game that broke my card table's (with TV tray extenders) back :') which is a good thing because I needed to upgrade anyway.

- Rules.
Rules, rules, rules, rules, rules! Yesterday, I spent 8 hours getting through session one two-handed solo. The recommended playtime is 2 hours + 30 minutes per player. That is ONLY if everyone is familiar with the rules. A lot of my playtime was looking up sequences of play, Native Abilities in the Gazeteer, how enemy keywords worked, how my own characters skills worked, and I still have no idea when Dungeons come into play because I only dealt with Clashes and Delves. It's hard to remember when to take the Adventures Rest Step and heal and remove dice. Is it after every town? Every battle? Every day? There are also guild quests I've avoided playing because it adds more rules and more complexity for one person to keep track of.

Sometimes I'll even draw an enemy, and if their abilities are confusing or difficult to manage, I'll put them back in the draw bag and pick a new one because it's easier to stick with enemy keywords I'm familiar with and would just rather play than look up another rule.

I watch how-to-play YouTube videos in my spare time AND use the DIZED App and read the rulebook and post questions to BGG (thanks for answering guys) but I am not comfortable enough to play the game without these training wheels. I've spent 25 hours with the game, and I'm still on training wheels learning, but the game is great. The more I uncover the more I like it.

- Time to Play
For now, a single session is taking 8 hours (solo two-handed). I'm going to continue with Session 2 with my characters, but in the future, sticking with one character for solo sounds so enticing simply because less table space, less time, less upkeep. I have 25 hours in the game and most of that time was spent learning how to play.

PROS

+ Deluxe Adventurer Inventory
This purchase is a MUST! Without this, my rating would drop. It allows skills and items to take up much less space per character. If I tried managing two characters without this, I'd need stretchy arms or an office chair to roll back and forth from one character to the other. With this though, it's so easy to aquire and store new items and skill sheets, and it also looks beautiful on the table.

+ Organization and No Card Sleeves
A big hurdle for a new game for me is always ""How am I going to organize all this?"" BotSE doesn't have this problem! No need to paint minis, use card sleeves, or buy a 3rd party organizer! Big plus so I can spend more time learning/playing than sorting/organizing.

+ Theme.
I'm a big fan of the video games Skyrim and Oblivion, and even though I don't play them anymore, this invokes the same feeling of being in a grand Elder Scrolls Adventure. I love the artwork on the rulebook pages, the enemies, the male and female playable characters, everything is so good!

+ Character Progression.
As Ryan George would say from Pitch Meeting, except I don't mean this sarcastically ^-^: Wow! Wow wow wow wow wow! Wow. (how many wows is it?) ANYWAY! It's SO FUN leveling up and building my characters how I want! Some skill lines are confusing so I don't use them (can't figure out Illusion yet) but I love Destruction Staff and Restoring Light (with a Master Healer Class) on my mage! My female High Elf saves us! And Archery and Lockpicking and Speech and Heavy Armor on my male Kajiit really helps out! On the mage, I find Destruction Staff abilities often drain Adventurer's Health, so her being a healer really offsets those negative affects!

Can't wait to dive back in and continue character progression.

+ Combat
Delves and Clashes have been excellent. I still haven't had to set up a Dungeon yet, but I enjoy the combat, lockpicking, ranged abilities. The cooldown track is very innovative and simple! It's fun recovering dice and deciding how to use them next.

+ Fun.
Honestly, I bumped my rating up to a 9 because this game is simply FUN! It's so fun exploring, battling, upgrading characters. I keep thinking about this game when I'm not playing it. One mark of an excellent game is, ""Is it fun?"" Absolutely, completely, totally YES!

CONCLUSION
ESO: BotSE is great. It's fun picking up quests and items and training and exploring. Every icon on the overland map is interesting to explore. The Deluxe Adventurer Inventory--If you don't have it GET IT! Your table and arms will thank you. 

I've actually cancelled other campaign games on Gamefound after playing this, because I don't feel like I need more with BotSE in my collection. I'm ready for expansions whenever Chip Theory Announces them! 

This will make a fine addition to your collection IF you have, you know, a big enough table, time, patience for rules, and the Deluxe Adventurer Inventory.

100pcBlade,7.5,"Arcs is a space game that hits the usual tropes like exploration, combat, building bases, harvesting resources, new technology (Guilds) and Area Control, but many of the mechanisms are novel with the heart of the game being a pseudo trick taking element that encourages players to play the same type of card of the lead player by granting them more actions if they do so

Like Wehrle’s other games, Arcs is very chaotic and the game is largely a tactical one either because you have to manage the hand of cards you’ve been dealt or because the game state changes so quickly. Throw in some over-powered technology and it becomes very hard to plan too far ahead.

abontrager,8.0,"Root and Oath bounced off our group pretty hard. When I suggested we try Arcs they were unsurprisingly hesitant. So far we have played 2 games, one without the Leaders and Lore and one with them.

We went into the game knowing it was a swingy tactical game with a chance to get a hand of cards that would be ""useless"" towards my plans at that time or getting totally owned in combat, mindset that I think is necessary for Arcs . It was a blast.

Unlike games such as TI4 where conflict feels personal due to the negotiation factor, Arcs feels more like dice chucking fun. Except...

The massive AP from the take-that-esque cards. Lots of restrictions such as not being able to declare an Ambition that you want, you must have a card that has that Ambition on it. This design choice has its merits but it does introduce quite a bit of AP on its own.
AP aside, my biggest gripe is the rule book. The amount of unnecessary use of jargon - replacing common BG terms at every opportunity - was so rampant that definitions for the jargon have their own call-out boxes. If you need to define your jargon then just don't use it. The jargon just made it more difficult to learn how to play and you could probably cut a page or two if you just cut it out.

That being said I was very happy that there weren't ""How to Play"" or ""Rules Index"" books and as a whole the rules are pretty easy to learn and teach (once you get past the jargon and just teach using commonly used terms).

Achire,4.0,"First play impressions. I think this game is excellent, but I absolutely hate it and I rate based on my own enjoyment. The good: fairly elegant, different objectives, the card play system is enjoyable. It seems like a quality game design and the graphic design of the board & art is perfect. What I hate: it's a game when you can roll a ton of attack dice against one damaged ship and damaged port and somehow wind up damaging your fleet way more than the enemy and getting nearly nothing. You can also spend several turns working to get a card only for someone else's lucky die roll to take it. The hand of number cards you draw can create wild swings of fate... yes, you will plan the best you can given your hand but it's undeniable that some hands are just plain superior to others (...it is simply better to be able to do way more actions). It's both super-restrictive, and super-swingy. I understand why someone would love this game but it was miserable to me.",4,60,120,14,8.12954,683,8623,en

The good feelings come from slow burns that may play out if you're able to secure ambitions.

adi_venturer,9.0,"The more I have played Arcs, the more I have grown to love it - something very typical of Cole Wehrle games. This is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, again very typical of Cole Wehrle games. But that's alright. 

The first thing I like to tell people when I introduce them to Arcs (base game) is that this game is 90-95% tactics and only 5-10% strategy. If you find yourself complaining about this game, remind yourself of this fact. It's a very different style of game that doesn't follow the conventional design practices of modern strategy games. 

I find this game to be highly thematic, i.e. the mechanics follow the theme really well. Unlike other space opera games, you don't play as large galactic empires with tons of resources that allow you to build war strategies. You instead play as young upstarts with a small fleet and limited resources, who mostly rely on being opportunistic to leave their mark on the world (the reach?). Arcs recreates that claustrophobic feeling really well. You always feel limited - either by your hand (the most common complaint I've heard), or by resources, and you feel powerless because you literally cannot do anything about someone attacking you. But there are times an opportunity will present itself to you - either through the court deck or a perfectly played card from your hand, and help you score an ambition, which might just help you win!

Arcs is the easiest of Cole's games to get into. The rules are pretty straightforward, and the player aids are very useful. The rulebook is very well written too! Having said that, Arcs is also Cole's meanest game to date, so you need to have thick skin to play this game. 

[b]Leaders and Lore[/b]: I prefer the game without this expansion. While the Lore cards are great, I feel that the Leaders try to lock you into a strategy, which doesn't really work given this game's highly tactical nature.

[b]Blighted Reach[/b]: I have only played through a full campaign once. It feels like a completely different game compared to base Arcs - primarily because there is a lot more strategy to it. Each fate comes with its own rules, components and win conditions. Each Act feels so different in the way it plays out - starting off as a mostly semi-cooperative game in Act 1, and turning into an absolute bloodbath with dwindling resources in Act 3. I absolutely loved it!

You see all of Cole Werhle's design chops on full display in this game. It's his magnum opus - you'll find shades of Root, Oath, Pax Pamir and John Company. I'm excited to see where he can go from here, but I have years of Arcs to enjoy before that.

Aegir2122,3.0,"This is a really annoying game to review. All the mechanics on the table are very nice, I really enjoy the ship moving, the fast lanes, the combat dice, all great. Everything else I don't enjoy. Not only do I not enjoy it, I don't think it was designed well. That doesn't mean to say that people shouldn't enjoy playing it, but it should not get all the praise it's getting. The card mechanic is annoying. It's designed to be annoying, everyone agrees it's annoying, but everyone else says that they love it for being annoying. It's this weird love of something so broken and weird that it somehow becomes good, like modern art. And I cannot see it. There is zero strategy to this game. You are not allowed to plan, because the whole game is based around what cards you are dealt and trying to work through your hand. But there's no real tactics most of the time either. The 'tactics' is just deciding which card is going to give you the most actions, which is usually obvious. Either the most pips, or the highest number to take the lead. The most tactical it gets is deciding to steal the first player token, which involves losing an entire turn later, which is just a miserable exchange in gameplay terms. The randomness of the shuffle matters more than all other aspects of the game. The cards tell you what you are and are not allowed to play, and also how you are allowed to score. If you don't have any combat cards this round, you are just not allowed to combat. The only way to do so is if someone else plays a combat card, and then you get ONE combat action. You can get combat chips, but if you aren't getting dealt combat cards in general, then the chances of taking and holding a planet that has them is nil. Imagine playing a game like Eclipse, but you are randomly dealt the actions you can take each round. That would make the game intolerable, but that's basically what you have here. The only slightly saving grace is that there is some mitigation for all of that, but it's not nearly enough. 

This is a game designed solely for people who love that one moment in a game where you can take advantage of your opponent's weakness and really screw them over. Except it's not the opponent who is letting their guard down, it's the game artificially creating those moments by forcing them in to a weakened state.

Also, I found the art, theming, and design pretty bland and boring. Nothing looked very cool, and 'tipping' the ships to show they are damage seems like an afterthought for these minis, as they don't seem to be designed to lay on their side.",4,60,120,14,8.12954,683,8623,en

Satisfying to play the trick taking action selection to get good turns but they're generally few and far between. Often the actions available all don't feel great, and the game tends to drag due to being more tactical than strategic which can cause a lot of AP on each turn. With 6x5=30 turns this can make the game feel too long for what it is.

Aigooleo,8.5,"A smartly designed system cruncher in which the skill ceiling seems to be very high. You calculate, memorize, combo actions to optimize power plays. Analysis paralysis can definitely happen.

Art: is fantastic, I love most of it. Color palette, graphic design, all WOW.

Production: is fair, the board is not of highest quality, and I would have liked different shape of ships for each colors, and the building tokens are a bit meh.

Gameplay: The core is really streamlined. I really like it! Love it even? but... you have to know what it is before going into it! This won't be for everyone; it is a very swingy, subtle, backstabbing thing with an exponential complexity and gotchas due to all the cards fine prints.

Biggest gripe; There isn't much ""world narrative"".. Leader Cards & Lore Cards help bit, Campaign too, but still not enough for me.. it is mostly about stacking point bombs and sneaking the grabs by finding combos. The Court cards have flavor, but basically, no story on the map/world really (with a few exceptions and some very specific moment to moment cinematic sequences). The galactic story gets dissolved in the amount of unfocused cards all over the place, most of them ending up as resources, and the volatility of the boardstate.

Overall: Right now, it feels slightly too ""gamey"" for its own good, if that make sense. But, the core is soooooo strong and modular that I can totally imagine a bright future for this product.",4,60,120,14,8.12954,683,8623,en

ajie426,6.0,"超主观点评（3人局）：
1、辨识度很高的root系列画风，大大提高了关注度。
2、看规则的时候觉得蛮有趣，刚开始玩也还好，一个小时后感觉很累，第三大轮大家一致决定掀桌。
3、3人局已经觉得有点拖沓，虽然主行动就是打一张牌，但是还有前奏行动，理事会、传说、领袖能力，结算起来还是需要蛮多时间的。4人局估计就要进入玩手机模式了。
4、太反直觉了，看见这类型的游戏想着就是造船冲冲冲，玩到后面发现，并没有什么用，毕竟打仗不一定有分。
5、各种能力极度不平衡，感觉都是拍脑袋想出来的。
6、每次摸6张牌的运气成分也很大，比如，想建造的时候，就是摸不起建造牌，那就是憨憨，或者起手就全是小数字的牌，也是蛮憨的。
小心得：
1、这不是个战争游戏，多战舰意义不大，打仗也不一定有收益，瞄准每大轮的计分项打才是正解。
2、尽早建造所有城市，解锁城市的附加分非常关键，多加5分可太刚了。
玩法：
复杂的吃墩游戏，先手玩家打出一个花色的卡牌，用该卡牌上所有行动点做行动，后手玩家只要出同花色并且比先手玩家的卡牌点数大时才可以使用所有行动点，否则只能用一个行动点。所有手牌打完则进行一次小计分。3人局，有人先获得30分游戏结束。",4,60,120,14,8.12954,683,8623,zh

If I had to give it a rating considering other players shared experience it would be closer to an 7-8 (But they can write their own review). 
It is a mean game. Very mean. I like to describe it as ""space crabs in a pot"", each player grasping for anything to pull themselves up or hold others down. First crab out wins, no matter the cost of limbs. 
I find complaints of randomness not very convincing, as there is so much mitigation available to the players. ""Good hand""/ ""Bad hand"" there is hardly a difference when an opportunity for clever play arises on the knifes edge of victory. Balancing the ""what I want"", ""what I can"", and ""what I need"" to do can be frustrating, but also very satisfying when executed to plan.",4,60,120,14,8.12954,683,8623,en

Someone in my game group said it's 4X.  It's not.  It's more like 3X.  Or like 2.8X, since it's so abstract.

Combat is interesting.  The attacker drives the entire thing and has dice that can cause himself damage.

The expected game time written on the box is wildly incorrect.  The box says 60 - 120 minutes, I think.  I think a much more reasonable time for 4 players is 5 hours, minimum.  Maybe 6 hours.  We ended early so I don't know a proper amount of time to play the whole thing.

I don't like how scoring works.

alzsara,7.0,"Each round you draw a hand of cards and on a turn a trick is played out which determines the default action (suit) for that turn and whether a scoring objective is set (usually by someone foregoing a later turn by playing an extra card, but it’s worth it). Actions are usually to lay claim to cards or amass/move units on the board, which is a Hunger Games (part 2) clock style setup, where proximity from one arc to another is shortened by movement though the middle bullseye. The resources being scored are tight and once apportioned you’ll need to move and fight for them. There’s no point turtling because you can never hold off in a multi-player everyone-can-reach-you area control game. The real game is seizing initiative enough to guarantee the things you’re strong in are being scored. The game is slowed down by the complicated card effects which get turned over enough to stop the game regularly and that’s the real downside, even though they’re needed to elevate the game from just being about board control. The digital scoring (this rather than this for this round) drives the board shenanigans. The game is clever and it works, but it’s too easy to miss out on any given round for me and I came to dread the drag of constant new card acquaintanceships.",4,60,120,14,8.12954,683,8623,en

Andy Parsons,5.0,"In some ways Arcs reminds me of old fashioned multi-player conflict games: the arguments and the negotiation, shrieks of laughter and of horror, buckets of dice, and lashings of destruction and theft.  I have seen Cosmic Encounter mentioned and that comparison seems apt, not just because of the space conflict theme. 

Mechanically, Arcs feels quite novel, with its card play that borrows from trick-taking.  A suit is led and, to get full value from a card played, others should follow suit with a higher numbered card.  That ""value"" is a number of actions from a selection that differs with the suit played.  Another key element of the card play is that the lead player can allocate a vp counter to one of five objectives for the hand.   There are a couple of ways to ""win"" a trick to take control of the initiative (the lead to the next trick).  Taking the initiative may come at the expense of taking actions on a future turn, but it gains you some control and, perhaps, some actions that you really need to do next turn.  With a hand of low cards it is easy to feel adfrift on a sea of chaos, taking few actions of kinds you don't want to do.

The random deal of cards and the importance of the led suit can also be mitigated somewhat by resources.  These can be spent to do things in addition to the actions the card you played allows.  Nonetheless, Arcs is not a game in which you can set a strategy at the beginning and pursue it to the end.  The cards, the variable objectives, and the chaos that is other players all ensure that this game is highly tactical with a fair chunk of luck.

The game is a long play - the rulebook's estimate of 45 minutes per player with novices seems accurate.  It is also a long teach, thanks to some novel concepts.  Both factors limit the number of times I'll ever get Arcs played.  In addition, while player elimination is unlikely, reduction to a hopeless position is possible, and that's no fun at all in a long game.

While the jolly artwork gives an impression of a galaxy teeming with myriad lifeforms, that doesn't really come across in the gameplay.   The systems we are fighting over don't even have names.  As several others have commented, the court cards that bring influence and useful abilities, present walls of text that are unreadable from across the table.

Production quality is mostly good, though I found the cards quite ""sticky"" and difficult to deal.  The rulebook is OK, though you'll not understand how to set up cities from the text (look carefully at the illustration) and - a personal bugbear -  the rule on returning destroyed cities to player boards is concealed in an example.",4,60,120,14,8.12954,683,8623,en

While Leaders and Lore are an essential part of replay ability , I would be wary to add them to a 4p game where someone is playing their first or second game. 
Same with campaign. It needs at least a couple of plays of all players to start rolling properly. 

Overall it's a multi-configuration game, where 2p plays totally different than 4p, where adding L&L will mess plans you decided with base game and where after you learned everything, you can apply over it the ""real"" epic game that will make you learn an entirely new strategy.

Everything in the game is intentionally scarce and requires conflict to capture and score pieces.

I'm open to the possibility that some of the module content or the campaign could be a better experience, but the base game is dramatically over-hyped.

HetSpelletjeskoppel,8.0,"? Game explanation:
In The Quacks of Kakelenburg: The Duel, you battle your opponent to become the best guild master. This is the standalone 2 player variant of the basic game. It is played in rounds, with each round consisting of 6 stages. Both players are given a bottle in which they will make potions. First, the player behind throws 2 coins and chooses 1 of them, the opponent gets the bonus of the other coin. In phase 2, players draw chips from your pouch until you voluntarily stop or your bottle explodes. White tokens (popping peas) place at the bottom of your bottle, coloured or black tokens place at the top (the bonuses from these tokens execute immediately). When your bottle neck is full, you add up the value of these chips and the last popping pea. You move the patient that number of spaces your way (if the patient enters your market, you receive the patient and place it in the guild house on your side). Your bottle explodes if you have to place a token on a bang square. You may not move the patient and must discard gold pieces (or move the patient towards your opponent). If your bottle is full, then it is the next player's turn. This continues until the players have both exploded or voluntarily quit. Now comes phase 3, aftermath. Some ingredients now receive their benefits. In phase 4, round card bonuses are distributed. In phase 5, from your collected gold, you may buy new ingredients and in phase 6, players put all placed/bought tokens back into the pouch and a new round begins. The game ends once a player has treated his 6th patient, or the 7th round card has been played.

⭐ Our review:
We thought The Duel would be a copy of the base game, but this is not true at all. The idea is the same, yet it really does play completely differently. We definitely recommend it for players who often play Quacks with 2. He is a lot of fun!",2,45,60,10,7.52015,112,676,en

LesChtisLudiques,8.0,"Ce que nous avons bien aimé :
- Une adaptation pour 2 joueurs du célèbre jeu Les Charlatans de Belcastel. Le thème est vraiment bien présent dans le jeu.
- Un excellent mélange de mécanique entre le bad-building (les joueurs débutent avec le même contenu dans un sac individuel et vont pouvoir le faire évoluer) et le stop ou encore. Nous trouvons que le jeu est accessible pour des joueurs débutants. Nous ne pouvons pas comparer la mécanique car nous n’avons pas joué au jeu de base.
- Le matériel est sympa et nous aimons beaucoup les plateaux individuels en forme de fiole.
- Il peut y avoir facilement un retournement de situation et la victoire n’est pas assuré. Même si un joueur a l’impression de subir la partie, il peut se rattraper.
Ce que nous avons moins aimé :
- La boîte manque de rangement pour le contenu. Il y a beaucoup de petites pièces et une boîte de rangement et à placer sur la table aurait été bien.",2,45,60,10,7.52015,112,676,fr

LienDdw,6.5,"I have mixed feelings about this one.

At first I thought it was just a good game.
It has a lot of different mechanics I like that come together in a fun way.

However..

The first time I played it I won 6-2 (patients).

The second time it was the other way around. 
It felt like I even didn't had a chance to win the game because of non stop really, really bad luck. 
If you 'push your luck' in a 50/50 or 40/60 situation, 
you know it's tricky, 
but it should be possible..
just didn't seem that way,
but okay,
a little bit of shit can happen.
But even with 15/16 good options and 1/16 bad ones, 
I managed to pull the 1 bad option out of the bag..
and had to end the game that way,
since that happened in de last round ?. 

In 7 rounds I had 
* one good round that turned 1-4 to 3-4, and even almost 4-4 (patients), 
* 1 or 2 normal rounds
* all the rest was just really, really bad luck with explosions, not much money to spend & not many options to attact patients

My opponent also said it wasn't normal 
(also, if I had to pull one out for her, 
then I did manage to pull the best ones out ?).

I really don't like games that are that luck-based.
The amount of bad luck I found out you can have in this game made me lower my score for this game from more than 7/10 to less than that.
And also I won't play the game gain any time soon ?..

(Let's just hope this much of bad luck in the game 
now gives me good luck in love ?..)",2,45,60,10,7.52015,112,676,en

Our task is to attract the sick citizens with our potions we are brewing to visit our booth. The mechanism is still push your luck where you draw chips out of a bag. You also build your bag by buying ingredients for your elixir curing all kinds of disease. Biggest difference is the movement of wooden meeples on the game board between players. Once a patient has reached your stand you move him to the guild house of the Quacks and by doing so you score victory points, whereas in the big brother a Kramer Leiste was used to keep track of VP. In the end it is not necessarily faster played than it‘s older brother and even the weight is comparable.

However, luck is DEFINITELY more of a decisive factor than the original; the game can be SWINGY: a single bad round can provide a runaway lead to your opponent and not drawing any gold tokens (black) can leave you with garbage in your bag. However, if the same happens to your opponent next round, it can swing back in your favor. If you can live with the fact that luck could mess up your entire strategy and ambitions, you may enjoy the experience... but ""no-luck die-hards"" should steer away from this game.

Piet13,6.0,"My first impression was good: it seems a good 2 player adaption of the original game, combining interesting mechanics. But there are some issues that take the joy out of the game (for us at least):

- Most important: the different ingredients and seem to offer a lot of variety (also the different sets), but many are similar and/or not very exciting. After a couple of plays the bag building element (the heart of the game) doesn't excite me any more like with other bag/deck builders.
- The white ingredients have a lot of impact on the game, especially in the early game. In two of our four games a player had (almost) only white ingredient on the first turn in one of the earlier rounds, eliminating that player for a whole round. That's not fun.
- Building on that. It's hard to catch up. So if one player has a head start, that makes it very hard for the other player. And at a certain point it's just a matter of time before the leading player wins.
- The rules could have been better: some situations aren't well explained. And I constantly have to look up who goes first in each round, since it is different every time.

All in all, the game is ok, but I don't enjoy it very much. Furthermore, I think there are better bag building games, better 2 player (deckbuilding) games, so I'd rather play those.",2,45,60,10,7.52015,112,676,en

We struggle to get this done in less than an hour, and we’re not being AP prone. It just takes time going back and forth with the drawing. If this could somehow be played in half an hour, maybe even nearer 45 minutes, it’d score a whole point higher for me. Ah well.",2,45,60,10,7.52015,112,676,en

1、主题好，画风可可爱爱，规则非常简单，适合推新。如何在有限的空间里摆地形标记以便住上更多的动物真的非常上头，思考量也蛮大，我们连续开了两局，每局大约30分钟（3人）。
2、基础面版图感觉太小了，还没构筑起来游戏就结束了；更喜欢进阶面的版图，这一面比基础的大一点，构筑起来更爽一点。两面的记分规则基本一致，除了河流有变化，但是不管在哪一面河流刷分都非常简单粗暴。
玩法：
每轮一个必选动作：拿3个地形标记并放到自己的玩家面板上（无需相邻，比较自由的构筑）。还有两个自选行动：一是拿一张动物卡；二是当地形标记的形态和动物卡一致时，可以将动物摆到地形标记上。当有人的玩家版图上只剩下两个空位时游戏结束。",4,30,45,10,8.01549,703,7224,zh

Alan Stern,7.0,"Reminds me of [gameid=231038].  Very similar foundation - put stuff in specific arrangements on your private board to score goal cards you've taken.  There's a draft element to both, but the one in Harmonies is much more akin to [gameid=230802].

Both Harmonies and [gameid=231038] suffer from the same fundamental issue - it comes down to getting the right cards that pair together better than other players'.  The name of the game is score the best you can from the underlying points AND from the cards.  Connect the two best and you win.

Fortunately, Harmonies is short enough (30-45 min.) that I don't mind it so much here.  I also enjoy the [gameid=230802]-like drafting.  There should be a house rule about the card offer wiping or cards sliding down or some such.  (I wish that had been baked into the rules.)

It’s reminiscent of Azul in the stone collection and of creating Japanese gardens in the pattern repetition. It’s all rather Zen-like as long as you remember not to take contracts using the same coloured stones as your RH neighbour who’ll beat you to them. Hope to pick up new contracts that auto-score using patterns you’ve previously created (the sure-fire way to success). Additionally create standard base patterns for supplemental end-game scoring. Balancing all that provides quite a lot to think about but you can plan when it’s not your turn so the game moves at a perfect pace.

(8.75) Cascadia 2.0. Great better version of Cascadia, same vibes, but more tension, faster and feels not so plain and more diverse each play due to 40+ animal cards and spirits.",4,30,45,10,8.01549,703,7224,en
Andy Parsons,7.0,"Comparisons to Cascadia are inevitable.  In both games, we are taking pieces of terrain from a central supply and using them to assemble habitats for various animal species.  In both games, we are scoring both for the animals we give homes to and for the terrain itself.  In both games, there is a tension between animal and terrain scoring.   

There are significant differences.  While Cascadia gives you limitless space in which to expand your wilderness, Harmonies ramps up the puzzliness, with player boards restricting both the size and shape of your little world.  In Cascadia, there are only five animal species and they might all be present in your wilderness.  Harmonies offers greater variety, with a deck of 32 different animals.  You can take one from a supply of five each turn, but you only have slots for four at any one time.  In our games we have found that the supply can silt up with animals that no one wants, at least temporarily, with no mechanism for refreshing it.  

The circular supply of five spaces, each offering three randomly drawn terrain pieces, brings to mind Azul.  However, Harmonies lacks the diminishing supply that gives Azul its pointy elbows. Indeed,  Harmonies barely twitches the dial of player interaction; it even removes Cascadia's competition for the largest area of each terrain.

I dislike both puzzles and solitaire-ish games, yet somehow I find the challenge of creating my own little ecosystem pleasing.  It helps that this game is easily explained, plays briskly, and looks gorgeous.",4,30,45,10,8.01549,703,7224,en

The scoring rules are clever and ensure you're always pushing to build _something_ which is nice in a game like this.

Player interaction is limited and the bad kind where your actions and choices are too tight to waste on one another, but players can also easily be fighting for the same thing and left to a feast-or-famine luck of the draw. More succinctly: you will probably screw over other players, and it will almost never be intentionally.

arsenal412,,"May 2024:
Interesting puzzle, played only solo so far. Artwork is colorful and the presentation is very welcoming. Easy to box yourself in and wonder how to get yourself out of the corners and score points. I enjoy the mental challenge so far. Score cards are clear, but you do end up doing some quick mental calculation(s) to fully grasp what each card calls for (especially with the nature spirits), but that's more a player thing than the game thing. Looking forward to more plays (and with more players).

Update Oct 2024:
Not a fan of the fact that any planning or clever play is completely dependent on tokens coming out or being available in the selection pool. You can see a well devised plan go bust simply due to bad luck. As such, I'm okay with this game. But personally would rather play Reef where all colors are available and it's more a race against the other players. Of the games this sees comparison with, it's my least favorite. Which is a bummer because I so wanted this to be the replacement for many mainstays.",4,30,45,10,8.01549,703,7224,en

But so that the situations in the game are not unnecessarily predictable, as in many heavy euro games, the jungle is full of surprises that come with planning, such as good resource management.

4Corners,7.0,"A well designed, well produced, easy to play and learn game that works for both gamers and families about exploring an island from a new design team and a well established publisher.

The game lasts 5 rounds, with each player having the same starting deck of cards and 2 workers.  On your turn you do one of: 1) place a worker on an exisiting action space (which requires a card with the appropriate travel symbol), and the do the action, 2) discover a new action space with your worker (same as action 1 except you need to pay time and the new action space you open is better, but comes with a guardian who will penalize you if not defeated that turn), 3) defeat a guardian, which requires a specific payment of goods, and gives 5 pts and a small one time bonus, 4) buy a card, of which there are 2 different types, ones that cost gold, which go at the bottom of your draw deck, or ones that cost time which give an immediate action, but when drawn later require scrolls to activate (all cards purchased are also worth points), 5) go up the research track- you have 2 tokens, the magnifying glass (the research), and the book (where you record your research).  This is difficult but important to do, you get some small bonuses, but also get a lot of end game points if you get high enough.  You also have the opportunity to acquire up to 2 helpers, which provide once a round actions.  

The rounds go by quickly until the last couple of rounds, where a player has much more options despite only ever having 2 workers and a hand limit of 5 cards each round.  Points are scored by: 1) cards in your deck, 2) progress up the research track, 3) defeated guardians.

Excellent price point, great rules/very easy to learn, scales well, good components, one of my son's favourite games, but enough going on to interest me.  Took a flyer on it, very happy with the purchase.  The cards provide some nice variability but I could easily see an expansion(s) helping the longevity of the game.

Abso,4.0,"Arnak has an awesome solo player opponent. The rival is a breeze to handle and gives an actual opponent to beat in a game that's all about gathering points. Once you know the rules you can solo through the physical board game in roughly 20 minutes. The solo variant replicates the game's core gameplay so nicely that frankly the only component missing from a multiplayer game session is the AP. Sadly those are the highlights of Lost Ruins of Arnak.

Behind the great solo variant the game itself is a lackluster mismash of mechanisms that all work better in other games. Arnak is heralded for its theme and modern mix of deckbuilding and worker placement. What theme I ask? The game is a themeless point grab where you race to climb one track and grab left over points from elsewhere. It's mindblowing how Arnak is noted as a deckbuilding and worker placement game when the most prevailing mechanism is the decades old resource conversion dullness.

Mixing all the small bits of other mechanisms just makes the game clunky and unintuitive. For some actions you use the cards. Some you use the workers. But the main action is spending your resources. Reminded me of a bad Martin Wallace game.

Collecting the resources is as themeless as it can be. Luck also plays a huge role, which I don't mind, but your mileage may vary on these issues.

The marketplace for different resources is fragile as stated in other comments here. You can easily go full rounds without a way to attain the sole resource that would allow you to advance in the game. And advancing here means to rise a spot on a track that gives you points or collecting some points from new worker spots (that all give you the same resources that were already available). The game is so short that deckbuilding is nearly meaningless. You buy stuff if you happen to have the money and the market happens to have something you can afford. You might use the card you buy once or twice during the whole game.

All the decisions I had in my plays of Lost Ruins of Arnak had very little enjoyment, fun or meaning. I needed these resources and the only way to get them was this.

75 % into the game I have achieved a couple of steps on one track and collected some points. Did I have to make clever moves? No. Did I have fun? No. Did I felt like I achieved something? No.
Time to play some other games.

Also, a special mention for the horrible board design. The game board is so large that it's unwieldy for any player count. If you keep the board in the correct orientation, the cards you need to read the text on and update each round are out of reach. Even the rulebook advices against this and guides you to play each game sideways with all the iconography and text oriented the wrong way.",4,30,120,12,8.06817,1081,14369,en

Thematic. I also like that there's this nice tension between exploring vs. deck-building and also between fighting monsters or spending resources to research. In research, there's a nice tension between getting assistants or moving further up. Ample deck-thinning but buys must be very strategic because there's only five rounds. Each card is potentially very powerful. Felt balanced & very much about optimizing with what you have to get the most out of limited resources.

LIKE: I enjoy seeing which cards I get to begin the round and trying to use them to be as efficient as possible. The game feels like a puzzle in  that aspect. I enjoy the pacing of getting new cards and knowing you will see them soon from your deck, which is less random than most deck builders. I found the cards abilities to be fun and interesting. The resources are very tight in this game, and I enjoy that.

DISLIKE: There's a point at which the research track is worth more in points than anything else in the game, but I feel the research track is uninspiring. Also, the game has little elbow-bumping, except for the worker-placement spots. Some randomness based on the final hand of cards, or which guardian gets revealed when discovering dig sites.

OVERALL: Solid game. Underwater Cities is better, by a smidge, for this type of cards + worker placement games. The Lost Ruins of Arnak culminates to the last round, when players zoom up the research track and squeeze out every last point possible.

2 plays with expansion, definitely worth it. The Baroness felt situational and the weakest of the leaders, the special power not as potent as the other leaders.

It feels like most of your points will come from there, but I do think the game is well balanced - i.e. the exchange of resources for rewards is balanced no matter where you play.

This feels a bit like ""Praga Caput Regni,"" but much less complex and also less bafflingly ""busy."" The theme doesn't really come through (it's a resource-shuffling game at its heart) but the evocative artwork keeps you feeling at least somewhat connected to the Indiana Jones vibe.

I must say that Arnak left me with a will to play again. Perhaps it didn’t blow my socks off, but I would definitely give it another go.

The game revolves around deck building and worker placement mechanics and the mixture of these two create interesting dynamics to the game. On the other hand you’re competing on the best action spaces like in regular worker placement while building your deck in order boost your economy. Sometimes the game felt a bit counterintuitive but it was only a minor issue, and you’ll get used to it very quick.

What makes Arnak work for me is the theme, especially the exploration element with visiting sites and fighting guardians. Games of Arnak are always fun. Some of the leaders lock you into very specific strategies from my observation, which can be limiting and make you prone to lucky pulls.

The solo campaign is worth mentioning here too. It is a collection of very well designed scenarios that really elevate the game further. Each scenario comes with its own win condition and creates great tension in the end game. The story is weak but the scenarios are all highly thematic and hence succeed in creating immersion while maintaining the rich mechanics of the game. I actually might prefer the solo scenarios over competitive gameplay.

Afrochiapet,5.0,"A visually-appealing game that nails a pulpy comic book adventure with its components...but ultimately does not deliver in many ways. It's a hybrid deck-builder/worker placement/resource management game that doesn't do any mechanic particularly well. 

Worker placement is under-baked and purely functional. While the placement spots increase in resource quantity further down the map, what is drawn is randomized. None of the tiles present anything outside of raw resources, so any excitement stems from the creature art. Additionally, said resources have underwhelming payoffs. You'll maybe exchange them for a guardian (no fight mechanics included). You'll maybe exchange them to go up the staid temple track (you'll need to in order to be competitive). You'll maybe buy a card to create a ramshackle engine (to get more resources).

This might all be forgivable if the game went all-in on theme or perceived experience. But that doesn't happen either. The game mechanics don't translate into the promised action and adventure the brilliant artwork suggests. Each game boils down to collecting resources and converting them into arbitrary stuff. Arnak is ultimately an unremarkable intro to midweight games that I feel is outclassed by better options.

I like the fact that we are adding more work placement locations, multiple use of the cards. I also like the multiple use of the resources to use them to buy more cards, add more locations, or pump the tracks. I did mind the tracks as much because it is often the only way to get a much needed resource. It combines to a very fun puzzle. There are times it feels like you are just converting things to more things without any idea if you are actually progressing. At the end you just count the things you own rather then what you built similar to underwater cities. In our two player game we both seemed to have went straight to the top 6 compass locations and I wish we had seen more in the middle. It feels like a few of those locations should have been blocked in a two player game or some restriction to force us to do more in the middle. It is still a very fun game, interesting theme, and one I want to play again. However I wouldn't rank it as high as some others.

Plus points:
Great production values for all components and very good value for money.
Lovely artwork everywhere.
Smooth game play mechanisms - ironed out some oddities of the original game.
Fortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.

Minus points:
The board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.
The rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you'd expect to find them though.
The addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.
We found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.
Lots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you've just done in order to replace it with something legal.
AP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.

Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. 

Everything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. 

The rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links.

LIKE: It's Brass, with more nuances. The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.

DISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.

OVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.",4,60,120,14,8.57927,1750,19619,en

adamscott,7.0,"After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I'm not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I've played), the rules are 'quirky' and the card play feels odd to me.  

This feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.",4,60,120,14,8.57927,1750,19619,en
adamxt,9.0,"There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.

It also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final ""oomf"" to the strategy.

One of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I've played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!",4,60,120,14,8.57927,1750,19619,en

Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso más duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el clásico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez más enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser más grande deja más espacio a los jugadores para construir y no está todo tan reñido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola más, en este caso menos es más, pero esta bien para variar.

adebisi,9.0,"This is more or less the same game as the original Brass except for the increased number and the new type of industries and the additional resource (beer). The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. 

Another change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.

I really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace’s trademark).",4,60,120,14,8.57927,1750,19619,en

adi_venturer,7.0,"I can see why this game is so popular, even though I disagree with its #1 ranking on BGG. I stayed away from this game for a long time because the theme doesn't appeal to me and because I'm in general not a fan of most Euros. While the theme feels very much painted on, this game is a hybrid and not a pure Euro-style game. The game is as much about player conflict (via area control) as much as it is about building an economic engine. The game also encourages table-talk and presents opportunities for deal-making. But the thing that stands out the most is how intricate and yet tight/crisp the puzzle is. Like Ark Nova (my favorite Euro), this game requires you to play your hand instead of waiting for cards to fit your strategy, and I love that. There is also so much scope for deep strategy in this game. 

The game is not without its flaws though. First, the game is not thematic at all - and that's always a big negative for me personally. Second, the game does not have a catch-up mechanism. Once someone is ahead, it's very likely they'll win. Also, a couple of bad early moves pretty much kill your game. I also found the whole beer/different industries mechanic to be kind of unnecessary. I've watched online plays of Brass: Lancashire which doesn't have this mechanic, and I think that might be a better fit, at least for people starting out with the Brass system. Brass: Birmingham almost feels like an expansion to Brass: Lancashire that should not be played as your first game.

All in all, I'd like to play this game more and can see my rating going up.

I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.

It's an intriguing game of give and takes. It's mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it's very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. 

Every system in the game is well designed and thought out. You'll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it's impossible to focus on everything. You'll have to utilize your opponent's resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. 

Many games remove all 'take-that' mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. 

I found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.

First of all, the production quality and attention to detail is off the charts. Including FAQ's on the back of many cards (where there are anticipated questions) is genius and also the result of extensive playtesting. It is to this point, and I've played a lot of ""dungeon crawlers"", the closest to RPG in the box that I have ever played. It has a clever role playing system, similar to a computer game, that rewards RP points for asking the right question. These points can be used to mitigate bad die rolls in the future. The ""RPG in a box"" style also includes traditional enemies, getting jobs to earn money, traveling to towns, and many side quests. As has been advertised, it is a ""green"" legacy game, meaning that you are removing cards from the game but not destroying them, and the game is resettable. 

As for cons, the quick start guide is good, but I think you need extensive gaming experience to be able to decipher it and get up to speed playing. Not that this happens often, but there is no way a group of neophyte gamers could figure this out. By saying ""not that this happens often"" I mean that it is unlikely that neophyte gamers would choose a game like this to play. The combat is abstract and it is a little awkward to pile plastic wound pieces on a playing card-sized enemy card when a location is wounded. It is hard to see what locations are still available to hit and it is easy to jostle the pieces and have to figure out where they were. There are other niggles, like stuffing the maps back in their boxes and packing up the game if you need to take it out and set it up again, but neither are reasons not to play this game.

The constant switching of map tiles and NPC states from A to B seems more trouble than it's worth. I get that a room where an NPC has left should now be empty, but it doesn't seem worth the effort to print an entirely new card just to depict a now-empty room. We are likely never going to revisit that room again, so you might as well just kick the players out and say ""the door locks behind you"" so you can't return. 

The RP keywords system is also hit-or-miss. Without artificially emphasizing the keywords, it leads to a lot of repetition and backtracking. I get that it's just a bit of fun put on top that isn't game-breaking or anything, but it still feels a little awkward.",4,60,240,14,9.24356,422,4050,en

arcubal,9.0,"There's a lot of handholding, as the production of its components hints at. Player boards holding tokens in specific places and a tutorial that explains 95% of the rules may seem super convenient and easy-to-use but they also hint at a larger issue: micromanaging as a game ritual. 

We're not very far just yet, but I wonder how much freedom to actually explore there will be when areas are too dangerous to waner into and your path is strongly hinted at by NPCs. Overland journey enthusiasts beware: HexploreIt this is not. You will have a set journey to follow.

Arydia appears to want to control every aspect of the experience you will be having, from the pre-painted minis in advent calendar-style secret boxes to the way you store your player boards, but more importantly, the journey you are most likely to follow. Like the tutorial examples or the head on your character mini and name of your hero, only the smallest of personal choices are yours to control but these seem trivial in a system that can't seperate location from difficulty of experience and yet seemingly avoids an overall plot.

Will Arydia pull a surprise yet out of its design tuckbox or will it end up being a smoother, easier to manage version of Folklore: the Affliction but remain equally a one-off experience?

argoforg,8.5,"There is both really good and kinda bad in Arydia; the good way outweighs the bad, but the bad is niggling enough to make it not a slam dunk to pull out every time we want to go to an RPG experience.

The good, among other things, is the surprise of it all, the way that everything fits together so nicely, even to the point of finding the small insets for the minus and check tokens beneath the skill tiles to help you know what skills you've mastered. The player boards are nicely set up to give you a great experience when placing new skills or items, and the slipcases are great for storing them. The surprise of new miniatures and NPCs and such is great. The active/inactive sections on cards is great. The combat system is actually pretty cool, using enough luck with dice rolls to make combat not a fait accompli, but not swingy enough to make people with bad luck complain incessantly. The Paths are well thought out and the FAQs on the cards are amazingly well thought out.

The bad sides are fewer in number: the sheer amount of cards and maps make Arydia a bit of a table hog; the gameplay itself is not quite as intuitive as the walkthrough suggests, and the phases of a game turn vary wildly based on where you're at, and the marker cubes probably either needed more weight or some sort of inset -- mine ended on the floor and knocked off my skills with very little effort.

ArmorSword,10.0,"This is my first 10. Absolutely an amazing and streamline adventure game that balances combat, narrative, and exploration with engrossing art and lush tactile components. If you love 'surprises' in your game and opening boxes, envelopes, or discovering your board game's hidden secrets - this is your endorphin rush. So much love and attention to detail has been poured in by the developers and every inch of this product exemplifies this. I love tactile games - and the character creation was so engaging and satisfying. If you want an analog adventure video game to get you off screens - nothing will come closer. 
- Side note as primarily a solo player: The turn sequence is so incredibly straight-forward that you can play 2 or 3 heroes simultaneous will little brain burn.",4,60,240,14,9.24356,422,4050,en

asgelb,9.75,"I received this game over the holidays and it probably put around six or so hours into it.

It’s really stellar, the production value, the system, the care taken to Kraft. Such an amazing experience is all really great.

The sense of adventure and discovery is top-notch, and I find the combat system very tactical and interesting.

It’s solo as well, but I do think it shines with two or more heroes.

I played it alone and I’ve had a lot of fun and as soon as I played it with one other friend, the combat was that much more interesting.

I’ve backed a lot of games on Kickstarter and have played a lot of campaign games epic in scope, and they have always fallen away, and I have rarely finished them. I actually can’t remember the last large campaign game I actually completed, as there’s always something that turns me off from them.

This might change when I get further into the game, but at this point with what I’m seeing, I will complete this game. I’m thoroughly enjoying everything that it has to To Offer and for me it’s scratching all the right itches and hitting the right parts of my brain.

It’s complex, but not difficult to learn or play, and I was up and playing after only reading the Quickstart guide.

It’s quite intuitive and I only need the rulebook for clarifications on certain rules or processes.

I don’t rate many games at 10, but this one is a 10 for me.

I’m lucky enough to have a gaming table that I can leave the set up on and I don’t see myself putting it away for a very long time! 

It’s not a cheap game, but you sure get a lot for your money. I hope to see this game system continued on into the future with expansions, but that’s not to say there isn’t a ton of content in the box.

I have the Epic Hunt expansion and Small Bodies add-on.",4,60,240,14,9.24356,422,4050,en

I don't like to travel around the map because it is quite boring and there aren't any decisions to make. The whole adventure system is extremly often interrupted because you need to draw new cards and / or new tiles. A storybook or an app would have suited this game much more than the cards / tiles system. I didn't care about the story (there wasn`t any) and the NPCs.

bigvolfan82bg,9.0,"Very nice game and a great production. The combat can range from very easy to very tough based on the way the threat cards come out. IMO, with higher player counts, the enemies are much more likely to get Limit Breaks.
There isn't a ton of loot in this game. The main emphasis is on gaining experience to increase your stats and your skills. Money is tight in the early game and travel is intentionally restricted by the the Travel deck and the Travel tokens. 
The gameplay loop is fun, but there is deinitely some overhead in managing the cards and the tiles. Managing the cards has been fine, but keeping track of the tiles can be a bit of a chore.
The travel minigame and the tile management have been my least favorite parts of the game. Those aspects, the quality of the tiles, and the tuckboxes keep this game from being a 10.

3/15/25: Increased ratingto 10. Returning after some time away. It just gets better and better. It's so clever with the terrain cards, the npcs, events, and so on. Things grow and evolve and happen at times for you, not on a preset time frame. Sometimes I've felt uncertain what to do, but there are lots of ways to keep exploring and even a way to ask for insight in the Exile Camp. It keeps being unexpected in the best way. The monster fights are interesting, fun, strategic, and don't overstay there welcome. When I stopped earlier, I felt it was pretty light so far, but when I jumped back in, I suddenly found more difficult encounters that just hadn't occurred yet. Excited to see what comes next. I don't think it rivals Sleeping Gods or 7th Continent, but it's definitely better than Middara, Oathswornd, and Gloomhaven, all of which I like. Very pleased. Having fun.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ ABC
++ The theme is really perfect for me, as this feels like Baldur's Gate in a box (I or II), and I have played a lot these games (and other old PC games in the D&D Forgotten Realms universe) when I was a kid/ young teen, so the nostalgia factor is high for me.
++ The art is really nice and is just there enough to set the stage and then to let go our imagination. Also, the graphic design is simple and easy to grasp and help us move quickly with the game mechanisms.
++ Awesome components! The pre-paint miniatures are stellar (and the build your own miniature with its separate body and head is a nice touch), the dual and triple boards are really well done, the metal ""coins"" (Kae) are nice and hefty, the cards are of great quality and all the other plastic tokens are great. Overall, the components are all very well thought out, and we can see that a lot of attention was paid to the making of this game. Absolutely no corners were cut rounds here, and the players experience has always been a priority in the publisher's mind, and it definitely shows.
++ I love the use of the advent calendar-style boxes where the miniatures are hidden. This really preserve the sense of discovery/surprise while you are playing (instead of just seeing all these when you unbox your game).
++ I really like that they use the back of cards for the FAQ, because this make easy to understand the rules of the game without having to take out the rule book or any other rule reference that usually does this: simply take the card on which you have a question about (skills, weapons, armors etc.) flip it and check the FAQ on it. In more than 90% of the cases, your question is already answered right there! No need to interrupt your play session for a ""quick"" check on BGG or an online FAQ.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- ABC
-- The portability of this game definitely suffers from the huge box required to contain all the components required for this epic game. In my personal case though, I won't play this game elsewhere than at home, so this doesn't affect me much, but this need to be considered if you plan to haul this game to a game night.
-- I will assess the value of this game once I have done a full campaign, stated to be around 60 hours, which is more than enough for us, in order to compare the game experience relative to the price of the game, but there is no denying that this game is expansive, so this will also be a big con for several people that would like to experience this game.

ChangingSkin,10.0,"The hype is real, our 3 player group is having a blast, our first session went for 9 straight hours before we realized how long we had been playing, second time we were moving a lot faster and got a ton of progress done in a 6 hour session.  Playing for 15 hours in just 2 sittings is a huge credit to how well the game flows and keeps you engaged.

Obviously we're still in early days of the campaign, but the story is great, the production value is amazing, we're always wondering what crazy mob we'll run into next and the highlight for us has been the fight system.

The combat is dynamic, each fight has felt different, from how the mobs behave or move, to how we have to attack them to make the most of our the hit points and abilities.  Now we're unlocking our talent trees and have even more to explore.

Ch 3 - I'm hoping this is still an introductory chapters. Our win was anticlimactic. 
Ch7 general rules should be generalized to the ring bearer instead of Frodo. ",4,20,20,10,7.99671,342,2808,en
Alan Stern,9.0,"This game is awesome!  It's a great iteration on The Crew - coop trick-taking with goals.  The goals are character-specific which is a small downgrade from The Crew: Mission Deep Sea, but the chapter implementation and unlocks are excellent!  If you like the setting (LotR), you can't go wrong.

As with other such games, the big downside is that success is entirely driven by the players' individual trick-taking skill.  One time we lost because one player pushed for his goal and, in so doing, sabotaged my efforts.  I can't blame him for what he did - we lost the previous attempt because of Bilbo's goal - but more experience with coop trick-taking will lead to smarter plays for the group at large.  That kind of collective skill is different in coop trick-takers.

Still, an excellent game!",4,20,20,10,7.99671,342,2808,en

Andy Parsons,8.0,"With its shifting cast of characters and a few lines of flavour text, Fellowship delivers a more coherent story than did The Crew, with its little pages of hyperventilated plot twists.  Fellowship ramps up the difficulty a little slower than The Crew, but by about chapter seven of eighteen it is certainly presenting some chewy problems that can take a few attempts to overcome.  Individual character objectives may not be difficult to achieve, but the demands of  different combinations of characters do create difficulties. 

The ring suit that is treated somewhat like trumps (can't be led before a ring is played to a trick), yet the 1 ring is really the only trump - and an optional one at that - gives the play of Fellowship hands a distinctive feel.  

The artwork is pleasing and card quality is good.  The chunky ring piece, intended as a reminder of whether ring cards can be led, feels unnecessary.",4,20,20,10,7.99671,342,2808,en

anim8r,8.5,"Non-communication co-op games are a fun challenge, and trick-taking games are relatively easy to pull out with most people. An IP that people enjoy, is an added bonus. This is definitely a Crew-killer for me. It is a similar concept, but there are more thematic justifications for the different scenarios and an element of progression and escalation. The production itself is very well thought through, with appealing and unique (considering the number of LOTR-based games are out there) art direction and a small box footprint.
Pain Points: The game scales all the way from Solo to 4 players with a variant for 2 players that uses a 7 Wonders Duel style pyramid of cards as a 3rd player’s hand, which is controlled by the Frodo player. I have only played this at 3 and 4 players thus far, and I have a nagging feeling it is best at 4 only. At 3, it felt a bit too easy and not challenging enough to want to keep playing. I’d be curious how this theory plays out in my future plays.

BoardGameOmakase,8.0,"It feels like a new Lord of the Ring game comes out every month now. Last year, we had a Lord of the Rings version of 7 Wonders Duel. Later this year, there will be a Lord of the Rings Pandemic. A new edition of Reiner Knizia's LOTR: The Confrontation (aka LOTR: Stratego) is hitting crowdfunding soon. And most recently, we have this game The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game, or LOTR: The Crew. 

Those who are interested in this game because it's LOTR might have no idea what they're getting themselves into. If you've never heard or played a trick-taking game before, it's definitely not easy to explain, although it's also not hard to grasp.

Trick-taking games are basically card games where players play one card at time. Subsequent players must follow suit unless they are unable to. The person who played the highest card in the led suit wins all of the cards (aka the trick). In a cooperative trick-taking game, players are given individual tasks. Here, for instance, Frodo must win 4 ring cards every game, while Gandalf must win at least 1 trick. 

For the uninitiated, this might not sound interesting at all, but man, cooperative trick-taking is one of the best things to happen to the hobby in decades. There's something about how it works, the way players' mind meld and synchronize, and play cards like some intricate flawless dance that no other coop game can simulate. 

The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game is great game because it's built on a really solid foundation. The stained-glass artwork sets it apart from so many other LOTR games. And while the gameplay struggles to evoke the epic of the books, it's fun to go through the chapters and be reintroduced to these beloved characters and the land of Middle Earth. 

✅ Solid cooperative trick-taking gameplay with a strong foundation
✅ Unique stained-glass artwork sets it apart from other LOTR games
❌ Might be difficult to grasp for LOTR fans unfamiliar with trick-taking games

btasam,5.0,"Some thoughts with 3 players...

Chapters 1-6: 
In hindsight, I wouldn't recommend this with 3 players because of how the game structures itself around mandatory characters in the early chapters. Yes, it's charming to be introduced to new characters with new goals, but besides playing with Frodo in every chapter, you don't get a repeated mandatory character (Merry) until chapter 4. It wasn't until the event in chapter 5 where we felt like there was some strategic consideration for what characters to choose. I think four-players provides a more robust challenge and appreciation for the source material. 

Chapters 7-12:
Chapters are starting to blend together as characters provide minor progression in the narrative and remain largely abstract. (i.e. Butterbur has to win 1 of the last 3 tricks, ok sure?) The Frodo-Witch King combo in chapter 8 was especially frustrating because of Frodo's goal in the 3 player game. Ultimately, we decided to stop replaying failed chapters because there wasn't much left to gain from the experience.

The first few scenario's are also a bit easy and not too interesting, but that is perhaps a good ramp-up. but it does mean there are less interesting scenario's to return too.

Good look, but kinda all over the place for me. Certainly some characters.

At the base it is kinda just a coop tricktaker that introduces new rules in each scenario.

As a hand management game, this translates to a game that rewards players who can keep track of cards across their hand, deck and discard piles and are able to take risks when they're probabilistically likely to come out on top. 

The few minor gripes I have with it are that some of the iconography, especially in the advanced garage and weather modules, are a bit difficult to parse - a player aid might have been handy - and the downtime at 6p, is a bit high, especially with a group of newcomers, and the rulebook doesn't make it evidently clear which phases can be performed in which order.",6,30,60,10,8.02695,1386,13091,en

LIKE: Fast to play, simple rules! I enjoyed the card play and clever use of engine heat. A lot of modules to add for varying the game up. I really enjoyed the custom cards that can be drafted at the beginning of a game. 

DISLIKE: No catchup mechanisms, but the races are quick. Some minor interaction, I was hoping for a bit more blocking perhaps. Less strategy involved than Formula D. Lots of card shuffling, consider sleeving.

OVERALL: Fun, solid game. I was surprised that it worked so well for a two-player session, and using the card-based bots for the other cars was simple and kept the game interesting. Pulling off a bi turn feels a little luck-based, so not sure how much I'll enjoy the game.

The theme of the game doesn't resonate with me, neither does the deck building - esque action system. The game is also a bit too long for what it is. I played a Haba racing game with my friend's 3 year old daughter, and I liked that a lot more than Heat.

In our first game, despite some people initially pushing ahead and some falling behind things tense and people caught up or dropped back, leaving the victory to someone who managed to just have enough heat left to bolt round the past corner and speed, leaving everyone else having to navigate it on their final round.

I hope it keeps this up over repeat plays, definitely a game where the more the merrier, and once you have it down turns are quick and enjoyable.  The only time things slow down a tad is when you're resolving stress or boosts, but its often enjoyable for everyone else to watch you gamble your way to a lucky position, or spin out in frustration.

EDIT: Now played at up to 6 player, which moves at a good clip.  Definitely recommend you skip the basic cards and go straight to the custom ugprades module, and if you're remotely familiar with games / deck building then you can include the advanced one no problem.

They really change up the game in significant and interesting ways.  In my last game I had a wild combo that allowed me to move 20+ spaces along the straight and managed to snag the lead when I used a +3 boost to take 2 corners at once.  That put me ahead for a while but a few others caught up with similarly bold plays of their own.

Don't get me wrong, it still feels competitive, but 90% of the time I only care about the other cars placement for slipstreaming purposes, and even then it doesn't matter. Once you play your cards you are locked in, so the turn is basically done, you have very few if any actual choices to make. The biggest strategy, and the only part that I consider close to racing, is predicting where your opponents will end their turn and trying to end yours to maximize your slipstream, which... Look I get slipstreaming is a real thing, but this is just dumb. +2 distance is the equivalent of playing another card, but it doesn't count against your distance for corners, AND its optional. It is the only interaction you will have with other players for most of the game and it's crazy powerful nonsense.

It really feels like racing, taking risks/heat in corners, accelerating stressing the car, using slipstream..

The solo variant is simple and challenging, so it's also excellent for quick solos.

+ Supports up to 6 players with the base game.
+ Bots can be added to a multiplayer game (if you have only a low number of players).
+ Stress and Heat (card) management: Heat clogg up your deck and may cause you to spin out in a corner. You can manage your Heat with your current Gear level. Stress cards add an uncertainty element: for each stress card played you draw an addition speed card. This can be bad if you have to slow down due to a corner.
+ Slipstream: get extra move if you are behind another players' car (player interaction and catch-up mechanism).
+ Optional modules for variety and replayability. E. g., unique deck building before the start of the race or weather module.
+ Championchip mode where you play multiple races in a row.

# All about hand management, timing, and probability / push-your-luck.
# No blocking, cars can drive through each other.
# Luck of the draw: especially for additional cards caused be stress.

[b]I do not like:[/b]
- No modular maps? There are 4 tracks in the base game. I suspect expansions...
- Decision-making is rather low and straight forward.
- Push-your-luck.

ajie426,7.0,"暴雨来袭扩展主要有以下内容:
1、1名新车手，配备所有必要的橙色特定赛车部件（现在最多允许7名赛车手)。
2、两张新地图（日本和墨西哥）。
3、新的升级卡（引入紫色水滴-不同的冷却方式，允许玩家从弃牌堆中取出一张热卡并将其放回引擎中）。
4、淹没的轨道部分（在这些部分必须花费额外的热量来调档)。
5、更多热度、压力、冠军、赞助和活动卡等。
感觉加扩之后车子跑得更快了，但是对游戏性并没有提升，也就增加了一点重开性吧。
超主观点评（加自动车，6人局）：
1、美术还不错，特别是玩家面板，那一排的仪表盘，看着就有感觉了！
2、貌似是个赌狗游戏，其实加了扩展以后策略性还挺强的，因为打什么牌，有什么效果都很直观，且有7张手牌，选择还是蛮多的。总之就是要控制打出压力牌的时机，能弃掉更好，因为其太不稳定，想要高的时候可能来个低的，想要低的时候老哥搞个4，直接滑出赛道哈哈哈！
3、人多更好玩，落后的玩家更容易蹭到尾流。而且最后一名玩家有可以多走一格的保护机制，这对于轻策而言很重要。
小心得：
高档位过弯时一定要控制好，如果滑出赛道，在没有热能的情况下，档位降不下来，可能会被卡2-3个回合，非常丧。
玩法：
根据档位，打出对应张数的卡牌，加总卡牌上的数字，就是自己赛车前进的步数。在过弯的时候会有一些速度限制。第一个跑完两圈的玩家获胜，如果同时跑完，看谁冲得远。",6,30,60,10,8.02695,1386,13091,zh

100pcBlade,7.5,"The White Castle looks like – and is – a pretty bog standard medium weight euro game. In fact it’s a bit of a throw back to the old ‘German’ style game (before they used to be known as euros) with a shallow theme and very stream-lined mechanics that plays relatively quickly (around 20 mins per player).  The only nod given to a more modern game is the (unnecessary but sort of nice) inclusion of 3D bridges but even these are cardboard and self-assembled rather than the plastic minis you would get if the game was kickstarted today. 

If all the above sounds a bit disparaging, it’s not meant to be because The White Castle does what it does very well. You only get 9 actions in the game but there are tough and meaningful decisions baked into each one of these and you leave the game thinking you’ve been fully immersed in a tight and challenging game Those older games often got labelled elegant and that term fits well here",4,80,80,12,7.9918,694,6030,en

adamredwoods,7.0,"1 play / 4 players

LIKE: Euro-crunchy times three! Very tight economy and dice placement game, lots of tension with 4 players. I like the different paths for points and there are some elements of engine building with the lantern bonuses. I like the multipliers with the swordmen and courtesans. I liked the idea of trying to leave yourself a die on the bridge to get a small end-of-round bonus. Relatively quick game, but it depends on your group. Great smaller footprint, compared to over-produced games.

DISLIKE: Turns were long, because of the high min/max-ing going on from turn to turn. Lots of permutations to think about. The dice placement planning can be random and fragile, say, if one type of worker placement doesn't appear and it gets blocked off early. Turn order can set the later players way back. Resource payments and bonuses sometimes were lost in large combinatory turns. Not a very tactile game, resources were kept to tracks.

OVERALL: I liked it! I can see why people enjoy it. I can see it's probably better at 3 players because of the large combinatory actions on a turn. I was reminded of Castles of Burgundy and how sometimes a player's turn needs to be recalculated if the prior player takes something another player wants, resulting in re-calculating the best outcome for a turn.

adi_venturer,8.0,"This game is action chaining on steroids! If you're a fan of this mechanic like I am, you're in for an amazing time! The game only has 9 turns per player, and feels like it ends just when you think you're getting your engine going, so it is very important to be hyper-efficient with your turns. While this does mean there is a lot of analysis paralysis and min-maxing, these are features of the game more than they are flaws. The short length of the game helps and prevents it from becoming a drag - which is why I am worried about the upcoming expansion.

Other than that, there is not much to say. If you like Euro games where you are super constrained for resources and have to optimize your actions, you'll love this game. The theme is pretty non-existent though, but that's expected from a game that's so hyper focused on a tight mechanic.

alicialaura,8.0,"UPDATE: I have been playing this on BGA solo, and my enjoyment has steadily increased. Rating has moved up from a 6 to an 8. Still, I will keep my early thoughts here, because I do think the experience can vary drastically, and the fun of it largely depends on those fun combos being present. On the BGG scale, my husband would likely rate it a 3, to offer a different viewpoint.

———-

A well-designed game that I liked more than both of the opponents who tried it with me, but being the only one who enjoyed it at all means it won’t stay in the collection. Strong points are the fast play time, small box size, and affordable price point. I can see why many will love this one.

The fun of the game is finding ways to pull off as much as you can with each of your 9 actions. It is very satisfying getting 3 warriors out in one turn, or triggering multiple lantern bonuses. This isn’t always possible, though. While the variability makes the otherwise “samey” puzzle feel new from game to game, it can also lead to some frustrating plays, at least at the two-player count. The experiences of my 7 solo plays and 2 two-player games were quite varied. Due to the changing castle actions, inability to stack dice, and luck of the rolls, a player can get blocked from taking an action, and be forced to pivot. This isn’t normally a big deal, but in such a short game, it can be really difficult to recover. 

It is also less fun when your opponent, perhaps by luck of these variable factors, is pulling off those mega-turns, while you are stuck scrambling for resources. As an example, in one two-player game, I started with an extra lantern card that granted a daimyo seal. In that particular game, daimyo seals were only to be found at the well. I triggered my lantern action often, and was able to take those lower-level castle actions that require a seal, use seals as wilds for coins and resources, and pay those seal costs to progress on the passage of time. I got a lot done. My opponent struggled, was often unable to take any actions besides for collecting resources, and didn’t enjoy the play at all. The game isn’t very fun or memorable without those awesome combo turns. I also wasn’t too keen on the game until I had the aforementioned play and enjoyed those power moves.

While I did not mind these fluctuations in experience over several solo games in a row, this inconsistency will be more prevalent when occasionally pulling it off the shelf for a play or two. And most of all, the fact that my husband was disengaged the whole time and not willing to play again (the first time he has ever turned down giving a game another try) meant it wasn’t going to stay. He explained that in other games, he at least feels some sense of fun or satisfaction in the actions themselves, even when struggling to score well. He didn’t find any fun in these rather themeless actions. It’s really all about those combos, and when the variables don’t line up in a way that allows for those to happen, it just isn’t exciting.

I enjoyed it with more plays, but not enough to keep for solo play only. I appreciate the game design, though, and would happily play again if the opportunity ever arises. If you don’t care too much about theme in games and enjoy optimization puzzles, you will likely love The White Castle.",4,80,80,12,7.9918,694,6030,en

It's really all about how to maximize your 9(!) turns that you get, so every turn that is spent just getting some resources feels like a failure.

I warn folks going in that progressing on the Heron track is a bit of trap if you aren't doing it for player order. The point rewards just don't seem worth the effort it takes to progress past the first couple sections, compared to all the other things you could be doing in the game.

I have ambivalent feelings about this game. The graphic design and iconography could use some enhancements, though the overall production quality is commendable. However, the design elements, like meeples obscuring icons on the player board and dice on the bridge blocking view of icons, aren't aspects I'm fond of. While the turn-by-turn combo calculations add some thrill, I don't feel they significantly elevate the game system beyond what's seen in 'Doppelt so clever'. The competition for player turn order is a positive aspect, but with only three turns, it feels limited. The mechanics involving two end turns and the left-side gardener combo also seem underdeveloped. I'm looking forward to a version 1.5 or 2.0, with improvements in both gameplay and graphics.",4,80,80,12,7.9918,694,6030,en

anim8r,8.5,"Another winner from Devir in their big-smallbox series. The game is tight and can differ vastly from game to game depending on what placement spots (cards) open up and when. Clever dice placement rules further create an additional challenge in accomplishing all that you want. With constant ebb & flow of action availability, their scarcity & abundance change how you play the game and how you value & prioritize the actions. While the economy is tight, and the number of turns few, (just 9!) the game allows for crazy combo potential for the skilled player— letting one achieve far more than what mere 9 actions should allow.
Many complain that the game is too short, but I find my agreement with that sentiment is not always consistent. I am leaning more toward the length making for an interesting efficiency challenge.

Christopher_S,,I really prefer the original Skytear to this one.  Onward has removed the hex based movement for so it feels more like an area control style game instead of a true moba. They never finished the solo mode for Skytear and said they were doing that in onward then dropped the solo mode for Onward. Also the colors or factions of the minis have changed so does not really work if you painted them already for the first game. ,4,45,90,14,7.78,11,147,en

LordTengil,9.5,"Played ten full games + teaching game on TTS, before the offical campaing has launched. A stellar game! Will update with more plays.

I only played the original skytear like 2 times, so I can't really compare, as that games takes more plays to grok. But I will say, that at least on the digital versions, the new board is a litte bit harder to read the bord state of. There are so many colors... But, you can grok and enjoy this after 1 teaching game and ana a regular one. But it still feels tactical and engaging after 8 plays.

All in all that is a minor gripe, and this is right now my favourite game. I am completely enamoured.

This game is for you if
*You like 1v1 games.
*You like a bit of randomness, but not excessivlely. The input randomness leaves a lot of space for itneresting decsion making. The output randomness is there, but it is quite mild.
*You like the theme of having a gang of unique heroes battling it out over a map with some control/resource elements, against the opponent's heroes. You absolutely do not need to be a MOBA fan to love this, but some jiving with the theme is needed I think.
*You like a game where every move matters. At the same time, it is not completely unforgiving.
*You like just a sprinkle of ""take that!"" The game is very card driven, and cards are hidden information in your hand. Most often, it does not feel excessive, but some ulitmates err on the side of ""take that!"".",4,45,90,14,7.78,11,147,en

I love MOBA concept and I was looking for a great MOBA board game implementation for years, trying a lot of titles. After one game I am already sold by streamlined rules and the spirit of MOBAs, this is by far closest to perfection I've played.
I am glad they didn't stop on (in my opinion) awful Skytear, which had a lot of nice ideas and now they can bright with a solid execution.

2dTones,9.0,"All aboard the hype train! Ding ding! No, but seriously. 

In short, not only is this possibly the most engaging, interesting puzzle a co-op game has ever presented, but the asymmetry and complexity ushers players towards acting as individuals towards a common goal, rather than the 'hive mind acting as one' approach often taken (which I don't care for) 

On top of that, the theme is wonderful and deftly tied to the mechanics. And variability is through the roof. And it plays great solo.

Rating based on a strong first impression - subject to change but likely to remain at least this high. I'm hooked.

edit: Have now played it with a couple groups. 9 still feels right for me, however a couple of caveats: 
- initial plays can run quite long, as people get to grips with the mechanics and having so many options. Not egregiously so, though; just had a 3 hour 4p game, which seems fine to me for a first run. 
- it's certainly a medium-heavy game and the fact it's a co-op might not help gamers who usually shy away from games of this weight.

Theme's interesting and unique, but I do not find this game immersive at all. It's more of an abstract puzzle than a story. This game, however, has some aspects to it that, combined, made me appreciate the cooperative challenge somewhat. Firstly, the different spirits are VERY different from each other. That means that the different players will contribute in their own, very unique way. Secondly, there's so much to keep track of that it might be hard for a single person to gauge the entirety of the game state and always know what to do.

Aalon102,10.0,"Positives:

Brain burner (in a good way)

Luck is minimized in this game vs other cooperative games 

Creative theme 

Solo mode is #1 

Spirits are unique and each play different 

Component quality is solid and the box it comes with has inserts and bags for pieces 

Game is challenging (in a good way) 

Alot of card combos 

So much content in base box 


Negatives:

The most fiddly game I have come across 

Impossible to teach without doing a practice game 

Super long with more than 2 players 

Very niche due to how punishing it is 

Takes a while to set up the game (app is probably better for most people) 

Will not hit the table often if you are not a solo gamer 

Does not scale well with higher player counts

One of my favourite aspects of the theme are the wonderfully evocative names for the spirit powers such as 'The land thrashes in furious pain' and 'Visions of fiery doom'.

Each spirit offers a unique play style with it's own learning curve, and are cleverly designed to require support from other spirits. While Spirit Island doesn't quite live up to it's claim of eliminating quarter backing, I have found it does an excellent job of encouraging players to co-operate positively without micromanaging.

The game is long and mentally taxing, so it doesn't get to the table as often as I would like. But it is always a satisfying and rewarding experience when it does.",4,90,120,13,8.33995,1781,23104,en

abrocker,9.5,"Game is fantastic so far (5 plays in).  Rating is based primarily on solo play.

Thoughts on Spirits:
A Spread of Rampant Green - Really love the fact that you can sacrifice your presence to mitigate build/ravage.  Feel the tension as you push to get rid of explorers while your own presence dwindles.  Current Favorite Spirit.
Keeper of the Forbidden Wilds - The slow growth is challenging and rewarding as you gain powers.  Would play again either solo or otherwise.
Shadows flicker like flame - Stoking fear felt immersive and I was drawn in to the narrative.  Would play again either solo or otherwise.
Sharp Fangs Behind the Leaves - Felt reminiscent of Thunderspeaker with the manipulation of beast tokens on the board.  Enjoyed it a bit more though due to less of a feel of manipulation and putting the Dahan in harm's way.  The limitation in regards to blighted lands felt frustrating.  Would play again either solo or otherwise, but again prefer it for team play.
Ocean's Hungry Grasp - Felt incredibly limiting for solo play.  Main focus was on coastal areas, so could affect settlers inland.  Would play again as part of a team, but not solo.
Thunderspeaker - Conceptually very cool by working with the Dahan, but felt very procedural.  Would play again as part of a team, but felt cold for solo play.
Confirmed that this spirit can work really well in multiplayer on games.
Grinning Trickster - Probably very fun when played with other spirits, but frustrating when played with only one.
Ember-Eyed Behemoth - Stompy Spirit that travels around the map trampling invaders.  Fun, but got a bit repetitive by the end.  Would play again as part of a team, but felt a bit samey for solo play.
Health Vigil - Similar to Thunderspeaker, I don't like Dahan focused spirits for solo play.  Feel very constrained by what I can do.",4,90,120,13,8.33995,1781,23104,en

acegammer5,2.0,"Quite honestly, we didn't even finish this game.  This might a very highly rated game here, but I did NOT get the hype.  Which is sad because I've been waiting for it for a while, only to be majorly disappointed by it.

First off, to me, this game felt very Dark Souls.  In that, I felt like things were stacked against you from the get go, you had to do things perfectly and rely on a certain amount of luck (2 of us drew power cards 3+ times that not one option would feasible aid us) in order to succeed.  I had the same issue with ""Battle for Greyport"" when played that.  People did not have access, even gated, to enough tools to make it work.  If I'm going to play something that PvE, I need to know that I have access to tools or success, even if I don't have them right now.

Additionally, there are a lot of elements to it that aren't intuitive at all, and we sought clarification multiple times via online, which isn't unheard of, but they were for basic elements.  My best example is the innate traits.  I'm not sure the publisher knows what innate means, but it certainly isn't how they have the game setup, and it was a significant frustration (If I can never get traits to fulfull the needs, then you can't use them, and since it requires power draws to do it, and then cards played, you just don't get access to those.)

I don't really care to go on though as this is just a whisper in the wind compared to everyone's glowing reviews.  I just know I've played much better co-op games recently in ""Paleo"" and ""Return to Dark Tower"" so I'm more than happy to let this dud go without a second playthrough.",4,90,120,13,8.33995,1781,23104,en
Achire,10.0,"6/2/2021 - Years later and still love Spirit Island. I now play at up to 4 players again, if playing with experienced players. Loving Jagged Earth. 

9/27/2018 - A year later & still my favorite game. I now tend to teach it with Branch & Claw included, as I've gotten very efficient at tea

ching and consider that to be the full game. Frankly, once you learn B&C, you just won't want to play without it. I no longer play Spirit Island at over 3 players. I feel 3 is the perfect player count, although I'll happily play at 2. Four, however, just causes too much AP, stretches the playtime, and causes some spirits to barely interact. To me, this game is a perfect 10 2-3 player game. 

10/12/17 - Now my favorite game. Will play, suggest playing, and will always enjoy. I prefer teaching this game with 2-3 players and find that as a 2-player game, it is actually a shockingly effective gateway game. By 'gateway game', I mean a game that actually makes a person who may have played a light board game or two get actually interested in board gaming as a hobby. It's a great solo game, it's a perfect 2-player, it's a super-exciting 3-player, and a brutally challenging 4-player (although with experienced players, an absolute blast). The endless difficulty levels provide ridiculous replayability and despite the game being as deep and heavy as they come, the rules are actually not all that complex. It's the strategy that's difficult.  

09/22/17 - After more plays, I am upgrading the rating of this game to a well-deserved 10. This game is the heaviest co-op I own, not because of the rules (the rules are in fact fairly straightforward), but because of the difficulty of the game itself and the sort of collaboration involved. I introduced this game to a friend whose heaviest game played, until that point, had been Smash Up and who claimed to hate long board games. And yet, she loved this extremely heavy 3+ hour game and immediately wanted to play again. It has been impossible to predict whether a given person will have a hard or an easy time playing this one. A player who plays games like Lisboa and Gallerist had trouble, although most heavy gamers do play quite well. This game rewards successful collaboration and an intuitive sense of synergies between powers and spirits. There is no downtime, no time when you are not actively involved in the game. As a result, this is quite possibly the quickest-feeling 3+ hour game that I have ever played. What makes this game a true 10 is the ability to endlessly modify the difficulty with invaders, scenarios, beasts, spirits, alternate maps, etc. This takes the game to a whole new level of replayability that none of my other co-op games can match. I am looking forward to trying the expansion and to getting to play with the more challenging spirits. 

08/28/17 - First play rating. Very different co-op experience.  Each spirit plays very differently and even playing the game on its easiest possible mode, it was challenging. I'm looking forward to trying out all the spirits, adding in scenarios, specific invaders, and so forth. This is definitely a game with extremely high replayability. Possible future 10, although I worry that I might have difficulty getting it to the table very often because of its complexity. Love the dynamic of the game: spirits start out very limited, but become extremely powerful toward the end of the game, just as the invaders start advancing more rapidly. I've ordered the expansion, but I suspect it will be a while before I am actually ready to play it.",4,90,120,13,8.33995,1781,23104,en

Crunchy puzzle, with an euro feeling, but with a theme effusing from every single part.
High replayability, due to great variety of powers, spirits, combos, as well as scenarios and adversaries that require different focus on strategy (I've hardly scratched the surface).
Great component quality. I love the illustration qualities, I'm seriously thinking trying painting invader and blight pieces for an immersive experience.
Only issue I've found so far is that it can be fiddly, with all the moving parts during the invader phase. Still, I've seen worse sinners (Mage Knight, for example), and the game keeps itself around the 120 min mark it advertises, which is rare for a lot of games (they usually extend further).

Acward,8.0,"I definitely believe this is a lovingly crafted game with high production values. The art and design is beautiful and the theme is naturally fantastic. Having played about 20 times, mostly solo, I definitely think this game deserves the praise it gets.

I decided to sell my copy, however, due to fine-tuning our tastes a little more. Spirit Island is a little too intensely brain-burning for us, with a lot of components and miniatures to manage basically from the start. We often feel on the edge of defeat until the last couple turns,. I don't mind such a thing when playing solo, but such stressful board states require the players to be on relatively equal footing with regards to stress, familiarity, and analysis in order to be enjoyable. This resulted in us rarely playing the game together, and the game takes too much setup to be worth owning for just solo, for me at least. It is still a fantastic solo experience if you don't mind the setup. I might one day get the digital version for solo purposes.

The variable player powers each spirit offers truly feel unique and match the theme of the charismatic spirits. The cards have a nice layout and are printed on lovely card stock.

adamtay11,8.8,"[b]Taylor's 100 point rating:[/b]

[b]Enjoyment - 18/20[/b] - This is the most fun I’ve had playing a non-campaign co-op game. The game is really fun and has multiple different levels of difficulty for whatever playstyle you and your group might be at. The game has TONs of replayability and really good mechanics. I would recommend this game to just about anyone.

[b]Replayability - 15/15[/b] - This game is the pinnacle of replayability. From exponential amounts of game variations, to playing different classes this game has it all. No 2 games of Spirit Island will ever be the same.

[b]Game Mechanics - 11/15[/b] - These game mechanics are really good, but I feel like they just start to scratch the surface. This get’s put slightly above a 10 because some of the expansions build upon these faults, but the base game has really fun mechanics, but nothing legendary.

[b]Theme/Artwork - 14/15[/b] - It feels near impossible to get a perfect theme score while being a strategic (non-thematic) type of game but if any strategic game had the possibility of a perfect score, it would be this one. The spirits are really cool and very thematic. This doesn’t receive a perfect score due to the lack of story, and due to the attention to detail on the colonizers, but the spirits are out of this world!

[b]Gameflow/Pace - 9/10[/b] - I almost always feel fully engaged in this game, it feels like you’re working as a team constantly to try and defeat the invaders. With that said, there are a few times when you feel a little detached from what your companions are doing because they’re playing a character with totally different abilities/playstyles than you.

[b]Flexibility - 8/10[/b] - I wish you could play with more than 4 players, but the game plays really well anywhere between 1-4 characters. I appreciate this a lot as a frequent solo gamer.  

[b]Production - 5/5[/b] - All the pieces and gameboards feel great. The cards are of great quality and the attention to detail is superb.   

[b]Effort To Play - 5/5[/b] - The game sets up very quickly and like I mentioned before, it’s easy to pull this game off the shelf in almost any game night with 4 or fewer players.   

[b]Accessibility - 3/5[/b] - Due to the asymmetric characters and abilities and all the different variations, this game can be a little difficult to get people into, but the game isn’t overly complex. Almost all the complexity comes from the different spirits playing differently.

[b]Total Score: 88/100[/b]

adelfaidah,10.0,"So far only played solo, but I really like the game, the abrupt ending is somewhat of a letdown, but I think upping the difficulty and including the branch and claw expansion should solve that. Apart from that, its a really amazing game, the theme is so well done, a very rich and deep game that completely replaces other similar co ops such as pandemic.

branch and claw edit : the events don't completely solve the anticlimactic ending but this expansion definitely makes the game even more exciting. choosing the appropriate difficulty for your group is definitely the hardest thing about this game, to get that satisfying victory. Nonetheless, the journey to that ending is always extremely fun

edit 2 (including jagged earth expansion): after playing many games solo and otherwise I think this might be my favorite co op game of all time. Is it a perfect game? No. There is room for more exciting mechanisms and features to be included (different types of dahan, new type of invader, EVEN MORE SPIRITS, etc) and it has its flaws (ap prone, anti-climactic ending). But honestly it doesn't really bother me. The amount of things that eric reuss got right in this game greatly outweighs any of its flaws. And its almost equally as fun in all player counts including solo.

adi_venturer,10.0,"The best board game I've ever played. I can spend a whole day writing about how amazing this game is, so just hitting some high beats here:

1. This game is a masterpiece in design. If at any point you have a question about how a certain mechanic would play out, ask yourself what makes the most thematic sense. The designer spent hours upon hours designing each element of the game and ensuring the mechanics follow the theme, then the developers spent even more time making sure everything stays balanced. It's perfection!

2. Even though each session can last 4 hours (depending on player count), there is little to no downtime in the game, since you are all either always planning your moves together, or playing your planned moves together. You are always engaged.

3. The core puzzle of the game has amazing tactical depth - very rare for thematic games. Combining powers to optimize your output, and seeing it play out is very satisfying. The slow and fast phase split adds even more depth to this. And if you don't like deterministic play, the event cards keep you on your toes!

4. The game has amazing replay value - it never seems to get old, really. All the unique spirits, aspects, scenarios and adversaries means that you have near infinite replay-ability. Someone actually did the math on this, and there are over a **quintillion** ways to just setup the game! The game fits whatever play style you prefer. You can go deep with a single spirit and try to beat all adversaries at all levels, or you can try a different spirit every time - the game will feel fresh and rewarding on every play.

5. The game scales really well from 1-4 players (I haven't played with 5 or 6). There are no separate solo rules, it's the same game at whatever player count you play at. Some spirits may be easier/harder to play solo, but that's about it. This is the #1 ranked solo game for a reason. I love playing this game solo, and I love playing it with my friends collaboratively.

Compared to regular DI, I might slightly prefer this one, as the cards are more interesting. The difference is however small. At the end, it is the same game. Just don't add all ad-ons at once.

-The card market gets clogged up from mid to late game onwards,  by useless 1-2 cost cards ,that noone wants to buy.Makes the deckbuilding aspects feel sour in the end.

I continue the enjoy the original with both it’s expansions..and there is no reason to not feel the same way about this. I definitely don’t need both, even though comparing just base game to base game, this is slightly better. But after adding both expansions, I prefer the original to just this. Have not tried mixing both base games and the 2 expansions into one massive experience, one can do that (rules allow for it), but not sure if one should?
I would be surprised if this does not get more support by way of expansions, maybe then it will decisively move ahead in ranking compared to the original. But if you have yet to start with this series, this is a great starting point in 2024!

Where the first base game is like travelling with the train, Uprising is more like a rollercoaster ride and maybe my favourite game of all times!? I like it more than the first game. 
What I don't like: The producer ""Dire Wolf"" knows that they will do a new base game and it is obvious that they knew this before they sold the deluxe box.

2bit,7.25,"Good fun, nice mix of card play, tile laying and resource production.

Lovely production quality (apart from the player boards which are flimsy and impractical), beautiful artwork on the cards and board.  It all looks very attractive.

Our 4 player game took us about 4 hours but everyone was very absorbed and didn't notice the time pass.  We played 4 player again (4 hours again) and that time I felt it went on a bit long really and was glad when it ended.

There were three things I didn't like so much.  The main thing I wasn't so keen on was that you might have spent some time developing your position towards a particular bonus/milestone only to have another player take the third and final slot, which means that your effort was wasted. 

I also didn't like the ""Most science"" award which obliged me to keep looking closely at all the cards all the other players had played, to see if I could succeed at it.  With small icons on lots of cards placed some way from me I had to keep leaning over the board to scrutinize what my opponents had played.  A bit tiresome.

And in both games I've been a recipient of the minor ""take that"" type of event in which another player plays an event card and chooses which player loses 3 or even 6 plants. If your plant production is only 1 per round it's a bit frustrating to have your efforts arbitrarily ruined by a random event.

Overall I enjoyed the game and would have scored it a 9 without the niggles mentioned above.

Tip: keep your player board some distance in front of you.  The board is slippery and the marker cubes you place on it are easily scattered by a passing sleeve.",5,120,120,12,8.3507,1907,25076,en

There are a few things that I don't like, but they don't affect gameplay - graphic design could have been better and the player board... is not just ugly, but the UX is just plain bad. Markers can be bumped, marking your production over 10 is just clunky. It should have been a lot better.

Regarding the gameplay, I can see that it may be possible that this game could suffer from ""bad hand drawn"" (as any other card driven game) but we are still to see if that has that much influence since you can mitigate bad draws in lots of ways.

For now, this is a solid 9 for me. One of the top games on my shelf. I hope it stays that way.

Two games never play out the same way. The combination of area control, tableau building and engine building gives just about enough things to keep track of. Another plus is all the nods to classic sf works and authors.

Very strategic (heavy focus on min/maxing)

Strong replay ability

Doesn't favor a play style over another (I have won by min/maxing different tracks) 

Doesn't need expansions to be good (although some of them are awesome) 

Negatives:

Rule book is awful

Game board doesn't look that great (kind of bland) 

Game is slightly lucky due to random card drawing (but you can mitigate it to a certain extent) 

Cards are not balanced (some cards are superior to others)

ablehat,4.0,"I don't get the longevity on this one. Maybe I get the hype, for the time it was released. But having only played it for the first time in 2024, its popularity does not make sense to me. An ugly duck that didn't quite turn into a swan.
Confused graphic design, omissions from reference cards, frustrating gameplay. A large portion of a 5 player game was spent sitting quietly doing nothing having juts passed for the round, failing to have drawn reasonably useful cards and not having any other options but conserve money for the 40MC building you need to play.
As a general rule, I like to play games, not watch them be played around me.
Also, I'm not a fan of stealing/negative player interactions in 2 hour+ games. This game has some super frustrating moments that can kill any momentum you were trying to build for yourself.",5,120,120,12,8.3507,1907,25076,en

First half of the game was interesting and the second half I wanted it to be over.

Note that I don't have issue with longer games in general.  I will often play 3-4 hour games with enjoyment, but the depth has to be there to warrant it.  

App is reasonably good and I'd rate it a 7 when played with 2 AIs.

It's amazing!!!
I've never played the original StS, so I cannot compare it to the digital version.
Anyways, this game just rocks! I've only played the Ironclad so far and I enjoy it so much. So much replayability, because of rotating bosses, enemies, tons of potions and treasures that can completely alter the game. Each game you have so freakin' many choices and options on how to build your deck, crazy. I've played act 1 maybe 4 times, act 2 about 2 times and act 3 only once - none of the games felt the same. And also kick-ass combos are possible, love it! Cannot wait to try the other characters!
It's been a long time since a game kept me so excited, to the edge of my seat and caught up in gameplay. Thanks so much for this gem!

Pro's:
- lots of replayability
- awesome combos
- vey satisfying deckbuilder-feeling
- perfect amount of luck for my taste (I'm not a huge fan of it)

Cons:
- cannot think of anything meaningful right now. Will add, if something comes up.
- now I know: it's so hard to beat! Not necessarily negative though^^

All these years later, here is another game that has us travelling from location to location killing things, gaining experience (in this case, improving your deck), finding gold bits and other useful stuff, and ultimately battling a big bad.  I guess Slay the Spire’s artwork is faithful to its video game roots, but it just looks dull and old fashioned to me.

Archimicarus,8.5,"Might adjust rating based on additional plays. Initial impressions after 2 solo runs (dead to acts 1 and 3 boss respectively) and a 4 player coop (victory!) run, my thoughts are:

I have surprised myself at how much the tactility adds to the StS experience. I could have jammed tens of runs in the video game in the time it took me to run solo StS:tBG, but what I want to come back to now is the board game. I'm interested to see if that feeling sticks (or if it was just novelty). Still need level 3 unlocks on all non-Ironclad characters, so that rotation will be the focus of my next runs.

I'm impressed with how much of StS didn't need to change, but more impressed with the re-designs made to fill the vacuums created by removing mechanisms that would not have translated well to tabletop. Defect's Dark orb design being tweaked to synergize with a Powers deck, alleviating a tracking challenge while simultaneously filling gaps in the Powers deck, is so inspired to me. I'm also excited to try out the 'zero cost matters' package.

Box insert and storage solution helps so much with setup and teardown. One of the very best. Despite being extremely faithful to the original, this is not an easy cash grab - the game has had an immense amount of thought put into design and production.",4,30,150,12,8.73069,709,6112,en

Then along comes Panda Spin with its cards that don't win a trick returned to hand rotated to their more powerful ends, special effects, and its element cards that win tricks at the cost of drawing two new cards.  Those same spirit cards can be discarded.  In theory, those rotating cards add decisions about when to lose in order to strengthen your hand.  In practice, the play felt quite chaotic, with trick winning bombs (sets of four or more of the same value) much more common than in Tichu, and hands in a state of flux.

If you don't win the trick, then the white side up cards are returned to your hand with the now stronger blue side up. If you play a blue card into a trick and still don't win, then all those cards are out of the round. Once someone is out of cards, they then get points based on how many cards others have left. First to 15 points wins the game.

Panda Spin wouldn't be a Chudyk game without his usual blend of special powers that can be activated during the game, which some may find chaotic, but I did not mind. The game comes with 6 suits and you use n+1 based on the number of players so the game is likely to play differently each time given these suit powers. I actually found the combination of powers and flipping of cards led to some interesting hand management decisions where you could improve your hand over the course of the round.

You have to reprogram yourself of any notions that carry over from other climbers, since bombs work in-turn only here and can be more than 4 of a kind.   The special icons scattered across some cards and the Chinese Element cards are all a bit random which gives the game a little bit of a lighter feel.   There's a nice decision space around getting your cards flipped vs getting rid of them and when to draw cards from the Element cards (since drawing cards is counter to your goal of getting rid of cards).    The cap on scoring is a little disappointing and artificial.   I wonder if a different end-game trigger would be better.

In my play, there was one hand where a player literally had no opportunity to play before an opponent went out, meaning a 12-point bonus and the sudden end of the game. I suppose this is what the inelegant Element cards are for, and it just happened she didn't have one. Still, if that were a regular occurrence I would consider it a flaw.

hazered,1.0,"Well, the art all looks nearly identical regardless of suit. Though I guess the suits aren't important for combos, but it's still annoying to ignore the art because of information overload. The important gimmick is spinning cards to upgrade them, even though this makes rounds last twice as long as normal. You get to improve a hand with multi-ranks and wilds, way more bombs!!! But also some boring suits that just generate/steal points. Most of the complex melds are taken out, to reduce up-front teaching, but in exchange you have way more turn-by-turn analysis of trying to figure out what your NEW hand can do. Not the worst, but it lasts too long for me, with even less drama than usual for a climbing game. Feels like artificial excitement, all those high combos appearing towards the end, every single round.

Irrlichtsammler,5.0,"Maybe I'm just too stupid for Panda Spin, but this feels like the failed marriage of a climbing game and trick-taking. Your goal is to get rid of all your cards because you earn VP from the cards left in your opponents' hands. However, you also want to bait other players into overbidding, which spins your just-played cards back into your hand, strengthening your future plays. This could create an interesting dilemma in theory, but in practice, it's bland af. Often it comes down to: One player plays a possible high combination and you passing because you don't have anything to overbid, giving the other player an advantage on card count. Eventually can overbid on a lower combination and the other player finishes you in the following turns with the upgraded cards.

This is based on a BGA two player game. It may be better with four, but if it does not work at a certain player count, don't put it on the box.",5,25,40,14,7.08896,77,581,en

joewyka,8.0,"Panda Spin is a very unusual climbing game, which is to be expected from Carl Chudyk. For the most part, there is the usual combos that you can play and try to beat to get rid of cards. The main difference here is that the cards have a regular side and an upgraded side. If you lose a trick and none of the cards you played have been upgraded, you have to upgrade those cards and put them back in your hand. Upgrades vary, from having each card count as 2-3 values, provide higher values, or grant special actions by suit. Having upgraded cards makes it easier to play higher sets or bombs and can have a variety of effects. I suspect in high level play you are almost trying to lose a few early tricks in order to upgrade your hand to go out quickly later in the game. This makes for a fascinating decision space and a very dynamic experience! Is it a little on the chaotic side? Maybe, but for card games, I think that's okay. This one certainly can feel chaotic at times, but it is balanced nicely with interesting and impactful decisions. When players go out, they score as many points as the number of cards the player remaining with the most cards has in hand, capped at 7. When a player hits 15 points, the game ends and high score wins. It is possible through special actions to pick up points, so a game could be over in as few as two hands, but will more likely go 3-5 hands. In each game, one suit is removed, so there is at least one upgrade that won't be available in each game. In addition, there is one element card for every suit that you can play when a certain condition is met, instantly winning the trick, but also forcing you to draw two additional cards into your hand. There's quite a bit going on in this game and it will be fun to explore!",5,25,40,14,7.08896,77,581,en

Jrb259,4.0,"Panda Spin has some interesting ideas.There are cards that can bomb a trick and automatically win it. There are ways to turn your cards over and to score big points and to unlock cool benefits. The round continues until all of the players run out of cards. 

Playing the game just did not feel like a very fun experience at a five player count. The entire first half of the first round, for roughly 15 tricks, I was unable to play any cards at all.

Larry Chong,9.0,"This is such an amazing combination climbing game (that blends elements of both Scout and Tichu).  There's strategy in playing white cards early to convert them into their more powerful (upside down) side! And there's also the Elements cards which can be conditionally used, or discarded along with any played cards. I no longer need to really play Tichu that often, as this version I feel is better implemented of the type of game I prefer.  It does not substitute Tichu for most folks but I enjoy this and have more fun in trying various hands (just like how I like to play Scout and try different nuances).",5,25,40,14,7.08896,77,581,en

mawilson4,5.0,"This one technically isn't out yet, but I have played on Board Game Arena, live with some friends. 

It's exactly what I'd expect if you told me Carl Chudyk made a shedding game. I enjoy a number of shedders to varying degrees, so I was curious about this one.

The conceit of flipping a card to a more powerful side if you lose with it is interesting. I really like that. You can instantly see your hand's possibilities in this regard while having a lot of potentially interesting ways to work through your hand. This is the type of puzzle that typifies great shedders.

However, the wacky, chaotic special powers and bevy of symbols with ancillary powers - Chudyk's calling card - don't lend itself well to the formula. It takes you out of that hand management and means you're just sort of along for the ride while random stuff happens that you can't plan for. Accounting for this would basically be impossible in a strategic sense, and so it's about 40% more added on to a game I think I could otherwise really enjoy.",5,25,40,14,7.08896,77,581,en
mdiep,7.0,"I'm not sure where this sits in the pantheon of climbing/shedding games, but I enjoyed it and will definitely play again. The rules aren't complex, but there are a quite a few details (such as the Chinese two), which makes the game feel hard to explain.

The spin mechanic is well done and adds both strategy and unpredictability to the game. You may want to play a card in hopes that it will be spun. Or you might play a high meld of white values hoping to win, only to have them spin and come back to you. Maybe it's better to play cards early before your opponents can spin—or maybe it's better to wait until you've spun a bunch of cards.

Hands or cards are open, a clear sign of the multiplayer solitaire vibe.  Unlike Wingspan, cards in Finspan are less situational and thus it is less about getting an engine going.  There is more of a spatial element as well regarding where cards get played into one's tableau.

Finspan is limited on player interaction, but triggering cards that help everyone when your opponents can't benefit from it as much as you can seems like an essential ingredient to victory.

Plus, I'd rather have an insect one anyway.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Like the original game in this series, very good medium-light weight set-collection engine-building card-driven game with a nice combo-building aspect to it that must be approach with a tactical mindset, as players need to adjust what they want to do to the cards that are available to them.
++ This game is a bit more streamlined and elegant than Wingspan, and a bit less complex in rules overhead, although it's similar in depth (pun non intended!).
++ I like the differences between this and Wingspan, making this a great spinoff: keeping the core system that we like and adding just enough twists to the system to make it feels fresh and worth owning.
++ The game flow is swift and the downtime minimal as we are often engaged in the other players turns with the powers benefiting all players.
++ I would have thought that the randomness would be greater here since there is no display of card to choose from (we draw always from the deck) but since we discard cards to our own discard piles when paying for playing a fish card, we only need to draw enough card and then pick and choose what we want to keep from what we have seen to build our engine. This was seemingly just a small rule but it does make a significant difference.
++ Great theme: I was really glad to see that the went back to a realistic theme with realistic art, as this was in part what made us (and I guess a lot of people) fall in love with Wingspan. 
++ Great components! The player boards have a nice matte finish, the included insert tray is nicely designed (although simple). If you also have the deluxe pack, the squishy eggs are awesome, and the wooden fish and school token are thick and easy to handle (but you do loose the convenience to just flip a cardboard egg token into a fish token though).
++ Easier to teach, faster to setup and faster to play than Wingspan.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The graphic design is good overall, especially on the form, but I agree with some people critiquing that the symbols are a bit too cartoony ad bright looking, but we forget about this after our first games. But this is a trend that SMG is going to, being really vision-friendly, but this is sometimes at the expense of the icons feeling a bit out of place with the art and theme of the game.
-- There are also some production errors, like having a round token too big for the space meant for it or having goal tile that are not exactly the same size, which is annoying. 
-- I would have like that the three columns would have also been thematically named, maybe around something like fishes that live near the coast in the coral reefs on the left part of the player boards (littoral zone), fishes that only live in the open ocean on the right (oceanic zone), and fish that ventures in both in the middle row. This would have kept this more thematic as for now this feels really unnecessarily abstracted. Maybe this will be addressed in an expansion.

coltbeatsall,7.25,"Overall I enjoy this game, but it doesn't give me thebsupremely satisfying feeling that Wingspan does. 

Things that distinguish it:
1. Diving mechanism - sets of your ""engine"" and reminiscent of Wingspan but moving through different habitats versus along one habitat.
2. Ability to ""build"" bigger fish over small fish - quite fun and provides some turn angst as you try to determine if the cost of the bigger fish combined with losing points of the smaller fish (being built over) are worth it.
3. The personal discard piles - the ability to send cards to your discard pile and resurrect them is intruiging, but in the early game is not that helpful. Starts to shine later on, but I feel like this mechanism hasn't reached its full potential.

Things that bring down my score:
1. The round end scoring lacks the variation and interesting combinations of Wingspan (to be fair, Wingspan's improved a lot with expansions).
2. Being able to place fish anywhere in the habitat without cost (excluding some special fish) - removed some of the tension compared with Wingspan in having to use up eggs to play birds a la Wingspan depending on how many birds you have in your habitat.",5,45,60,10,7.7874,186,1896,en

corry26,7.0,"Finspan is another take on the serie after the really good wyrmspan. This time you have divers and you try to add fishes in your tableau to make an engine to make the most points (collecting cards, fish token, eggs etc...). The game is the most streamlined of the 3 but i think it looses an edge on wyrmspan that was more gamer and felt already easy enough to table. I liked the game but i have had enough attempts at playing all those different Span games and will stick with wyrmspan even if i like the theme less then finspan because of the gameplay that is just better (more depth).",5,45,60,10,7.7874,186,1896,en

deedw,7.0,"02/2025: In „Flossenschlag“ tauchen wir in die Tiefe hinab und erforschen Fische. Hierfür spielen wir über vier Wochen/Runden und haben sechs Tauchen/Aktionen zur Verfügung. Ich kann einen Taucher einsetzen, um einen Fisch aus meiner Hand auf mein eigenes Meerestableau zu spielen. Die Fische haben dabei Kosten, sodass ich mitunter Handkarten abwerfen oder Fischeier oder Fischjunge dafür abgeben muss. Daneben haben manche Fische Einschränkungen an den Lebensraum, sodass sie eher an der Meeresoberfläche, in der Mitte des Meeres oder am Meeresgrund im Dunkeln leben. Drei Bahnen/Spalten stehen mir für die Platzierung zur Verfügung, wobei ich kleinere Fische auch auffressen/überdecken kann. Manche Fische geben mir einen Bonus (neue Handkarten, Fischeier oder aus Eiern schlüpfende Fischjunge) beim Ausspielen, andere erst einen Bonus am Spielende und manche einen Bonus beim Tauchgang.

Das ist die Alternative zum Fischkarten ausspielen: Ich kann einen meiner Taucher auch in einer der drei Bahnen/Spalten hinabtauchen lassen. Dabei werden die drei Bereiche (oben, Mitte, unten) aktiviert und ich erhalte einen Bonus, wenn sich mindestens ein Fisch darin befindet. Zusätzlich erhalte ich auch einen Bonus von Fischen, welche einen Aktivierungsbonus haben. In der linken Spalte erhalte ich hauptsächlich neue Karten, in der mittleren Spalte erhalte ich hauptsächlich Eier und in der rechten Spalte schlüpfen oder bewegen sich die Fischjungen. Wenn drei Fischjunge aufeinandertreffen, gründen sie eine Fischschule, die mehr Siegpunkte bringt. Am Ende jeder Runde gibt es eine kleine Zwischenwertung je nach ausliegenden Errungenschaften. Und nach vier Runden werden die Punkte der Errungenschaften sowie Punkte aller Tiere, Fischschulen, Eier und Jungen addiert, und die beste Taucherin gewinnt.

„Flossenschlag“ entführt uns zwar in die Tiefen der Meere, doch die thematische Tiefe bleibt hinter den Mechanismen zurück. Für mich fühlte es sich so an, als wenn das von „Flügelschlag“ übernommene Thema der Tiererforschung eher generisch in ein anderes Setting gepresst wurde. Warum Fische plötzlich Eier legen oder Jungtiere schlüpfen, wenn ich tauche, erschließt sich mir nicht so richtig. Und noch weniger verständlich ist für mich, wenn beim Überdecken – sprich Auffressen – eines Fisches, dessen Eier und Jungtiere von einem neuen Fisch einfach „adoptiert“ werden. Der Mechanismus mag funktional sein, aber er hilft mir nicht beim Eintauchen in eine authentische Unterwasserwelt. So konzentrierte ich mich hauptsächlich auf die – recht gute und klare – Symbolik und das, was ich gerade brauche, um die Kosten einer Fischkarte zu decken. Die Errungenschaften halfen glücklicherweise bereits ab der ersten Runde dabei, ein Ziel zu verfolgen. Diese steuerten zwar nur einen kleinen Teil der Endpunktzahl bei, sorgten aber dafür, dass ich von Anfang an eine Richtung für meine Strategie fand.

Und zumindest nach einer Partie konnte ich sehen, dass man – auch wenn es vielleicht nicht stark unterschiedliche Strategien gibt – zumindest den Fokus unterschiedlich setzen kann. So konzentrierte ich mich eher auf die Punkte durch Fische, ließ dabei die Errungenschaften an den Rundenenden etwas außer Acht. Gewinnen wird man vermutlich, wenn man es schafft, alle Punktebedingungen unter einen Hut zu bringen und zu optimieren. Im Kern wird sich „Flossenschlag“ jede Partie aber sehr ähnlich spielen. Die Variabilität ist vor allem durch die 125 Fischkarten gegeben, auf die man aber nicht gezielt spielen kann, sondern sich eher taktisch je nach Kartenhand anpassen muss. Dazu gibt es noch unterschiedliche Errungenschaften, die zumindest die Zwischenziele leicht variieren.

Grafisch gesehen ist „Flossenschlag“ schon etwas fürs Auge. Die Fischillustrationen von Ana María Martínez, Catalina Martínez und Mesa Schumacher gefallen mir wirklich gut, da die detaillierten Darstellungen der Fische mit ein bisschen Flavortext etwas thematische Stimmung ins Spiel bringen. Hier lohnt sich in meinen Augen das Warten auf die deutschsprachige Version von Feuerland, da die deutschen Fischbezeichnungen und Textbeschreibung dann einfach für ein besseres Eintauchen in die Unterwasserwelt sorgen. Auch die Spielertableaus sind sehr hübsch anzusehen, wobei im Laufe der Partie hiervon immer wenig übrig bleibt, da sie ja bedeckt werden und die weißen Fischkarten dann eher wie die Auslage im Fischmarkt wirken. Leider fällt die grafische Gestaltung der Eier und geschlüpften Fische ein bisschen ab. Die Grafiken für diese Plättchen sind recht simpel gehalten und überdecken, je nach Menge, auch noch die hübschen Illustrationen der Fische teilweise. Hier hätte ich mir – auch abseits von Deluxekomponenten – etwas mehr Kreativität bei der Umsetzung gewünscht. Wie oben geschrieben, ist die Symbolik dadurch aber recht klar. Ich fand es anfangs nur etwas verwirrend, dass die gleichen Symbole sowohl für Ausgaben als auch für Einkünfte verwendet werden. Diese Unsicherheit legt sich aber sehr schnell, da die Position auf den Fischkarten klar angibt, worum es sich handelt.

Insgesamt fällt der Einstieg in das Spiel recht leicht. Die Anleitung ist klar und lässt sich schnell verstehen, sodass ich das Spiel nach einmaligem Lesen der Regeln schon erklären konnte. Die geringe Komplexität sorgt dafür, dass ich schnell ins Spiel hineinfinden konnte, ohne groß etwas nachschlagen zu müssen. Und durch die Errungenschaften war ich trotz der Fülle an Optionen nicht sofort erschlagen, sondern wusste grob, in welche Richtung ich etwas machen will. Von der Komplexität würde ich daher „Flossenschlag“ auch unterhalb von „Flügelschlag“ ansiedeln. Meine Partien darin sind zwar schon eine Weile her, aber ich habe „Flügelschlag“ knobellastiger in Erinnerung.

Bei „Flossenschlag“ hat sich in unserer Partie auch ein gewisser Rhythmus gezeigt: Ich brauche Karten, also tauche ich in der linken Spalte. Zum Ausspielen benötige ich oft Eier, dann tauche ich zuvor in die mittlere Spalte. Und wenn Jungtiere als Anforderung zum Ausspielen benötigt werden, tauche ich einmal ganz rechts ab. Danach spiele ich meine Fischkarten aus, wodurch ich die gesammelten Ressourcen verliere und fange erneut an. Natürlich ist die Kunst, dass ich durch das Ausspielen von Fischkarten auch wieder etwas erhalte. Und durch das Entdecken von Fischen in den Bereichen ergibt sich ein kleines Engine-Building, sodass die Tauchgänge lukrativer werden. Aber zumindest in unserer Partie lag bei mir bereits nach der Hälfte der Partie in jedem Bereich ein Fisch, wodurch die Engine an ihre Grenze stieß. Einzig weitere Fische mit Aktivierungsbonus veränderten das ein wenig. Dadurch ist die Spannungskurve in einer Partie schön ansteigend, flacht dann aber ab der Mitte etwas ab. Dennoch fand ich die Optimierung des eigenen Tableaus bis zum Partie-Ende hin interessant.

Etwas schade ist, dass ich dabei wirklich nur mein eigenes Tableau optimiere. Die Interaktion im Spiel ist fast nicht vorhanden. Jeder spielt hauptsächlich für sich, optimiert die eigene Engine und generiert eigene Siegpunkte. Auch bei „Flügelschlag“ ist die Interaktion nicht sehr hoch, wobei diese durch die Wertung zumindest ein bisschen vorhanden war, soweit ich mich erinnere. Bei „Flossenschlag“ ist die einzige Interaktion, dass die Spielerin, welche ein Rundenziel am besten erfüllt, noch einmal drei Punkte extra bekommt. Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass dies wirklich dafür sorgt, dass ein „Rennen“ um die Ziele stattfindet. Bei mehr als zwei Spielerinnen verlängert sich eigentlich auch nur die Wartezeit auf den eigenen Zug, die Spannung bleibt die Gleiche. Immerhin sind die Züge relativ schnell abgehandelt, wobei die Tauchgänge, wenn viele Fische mit Aktivierungsbonus ausliegen, schon ein bisschen dauern können. Ich würde mit ca. 30 Minuten Spielzeit pro Spielerin rechnen – womit ich nicht weiß, wie man die Angabe von 45 bis 60 Minuten für die Vollbesetzung zu fünft einhalten will. Damit bietet sich „Flossenschlag“ sicherlich für das Solospiel an, dessen Modus ich aber nicht getestet habe.

Wer „Flügelschlag“ kennt, wird in „Flossenschlag“ viele bekannte Mechanismen wiedererkennen. Die Grundstruktur des Spiels ist ähnlich: Ich spiele Karten, ziehe neue Karten, lege Eier ab und optimiere meine Siegpunkte. „Flügelschlag“ mag insgesamt etwas komplexer sein, aber die Parallelen sind gewollt unübersehbar. Trotzdem hat „Flossenschlag“ seinen eigenen Charme und bietet ein schnelles, solides Spielerlebnis, das besonders zu zweit gut funktioniert. Im Vergleich zu anderen Engine-Building-Spielen habe ich nicht die Möglichkeit, eine wirklich monumentale Maschine zu erschaffen. Es bleibt eher bei einer simplen Ressourcen- und Punkt-Optimierung, was für manche Spielerinnen völlig ausreicht, aber für andere vielleicht zu wenig Tiefgang bietet. Wer ein einfaches Eurogame mit wenig Interaktion und einer simplen Engine sucht, wird hier fündig. Es ist ein Spiel, das mir einmal Spaß macht, aber auch nicht unbedingt nach einer Vielzahl von Partien ruft, sodass es bei mir vermutlich auch nie wieder eine geben wird.

Der Gwiedo,7.2,"Players have 6 workers to use on their own board in order to score VP over 4 rounds. With these workers they can place fish onto their board for a certain cost (egg, small fish, hand cards, cover another fish on your board). These fish give a certain reward, some immediately when placed, other when activated. Activation is triggered by the use of a worker as a diver. This implies the worker goes down your board from top to bottom in 1 of 3 columns. Each column is divided into 3 areas (shallow, inbetween and deep water). When you have a fish in such an area a column action is triggered by the diver. Each time the diver meets a fish with an activation property, this fish is activated as well. When reaching the bottom of the column an extra action is triggered once per round (all other actions can be triggered multiple times per round).
Actions are: placing an egg on a fish, hatching an egg, moving a small fish or a school of fish (a school is formed as soon as 3 small fish are together in 1 area), drawing hand cards (from the draw deck or your personal discard deck), eating a small fish by covering it with a larger one. Some actions can be performed by all players when triggered.
After round 1 players receive 1VP for each egg or small fish on their board, after round 2 2VP for each row of their board filled (= 3 fish in a row), after round 3 2VP for each school of fish on their board, and after the final round final scoring takes place: VP for extra points on fish, value printed on the fish, 1VP for each egg, small fish and consumed fish underneath a larger one, 6VP for each school of fish.
There is no interaction between the players. Each player plays on his/her own board and works on a VP puzzle. ",5,45,60,10,7.7874,186,1896,en

Andy Parsons,5.0,"Andromeda's looks are deceptive.  The big miniatures, the ship upgrades, the hostile aliens, the buckets of dice, the planet tiles, and the technological development all point to this being a 4X game.  

To me, it felt more like a modern euro.  Your ships are (mainly) workers, visiting planets in order to grab resources, use the facilities, and build buildings.  When you recall the workers to base, to operate your engine.  What do buildings do?  They score points, of course.  However, the most points are to be scored by progressing up tracks related to four resource types and their technologies.  

A fifth track, appropriately blood red, signals that Andromeda is not entirely a heads-down efficiency puzzle.  In order to progress up it you need to win battles against those hostile aliens or your fellow players. This game does have some eXterminate after all.  Given everything else going on, it's understandable that combat is kept simple.  It is quite random, but the consequences of losing are not awful.  Planets do not change hands, buildings are not destroyed, technologies are not stolen or dismantled.

So far as my tastes are concerned, all this makes Andromeda a decidedly mixed bag.  I dislike engine building, track climbing, worker placers.  I do like the higher level of player interaction than is normally associated with these things.

Three things push Andromeda firmly over the not for me line. The first is an unpack, set-up and teach time of about an hour.  The second is the overwhelming amount of stuff to be aware of and to understand.  I am not at all surprised that, at the time of writing, Andromeda's rules forum runs to 483 posts.  In the game we played (three novices with a veteran of three plays) there was frequent searching of the rules and of a really badly ordered appendix to try and pin down exactly what effects particular things had.  The third is downtime.  Turns range from a brief place a ship and take a resource to running a complex engine while tossing in tactics cards to get more or better from it.  If your three opponents each contrive a big turn, there will be time to eat lunch before you next place a ship/worker.

Andromeda being a typical product of crowdfunding, the box is huge and stuffed full of high quality components.  While the player ships are a real step up from the likes of first edition Eclipse, the hostile aliens are fabulous.  It's a shame that only a subset appears each game.  As a geekbuddy noted, the overall impression that this game creates is of something ""...incredibly beautiful, busy, and messy.""",4,80,160,14,8.38933,388,3565,en

anim8r,6.0,"I thought Dwellings of Eldervale was a good enough game, and was curious about Andromeda's Edge despite its space theme because I'd heard of all the improvements. However, the huge production on the table had an aesthetic that was a complete turn-off for me. Typical sci-fi design language which I find less than engaging. The gameplay was fine, but again I feel that I can get a similar experience in many other Euros with a theme and production more to my tastes.

bfrizb,7.5,"2024-09-25: Re-rated from 8.5 to 7.5 just a few days after playing it for the first time.

The faction special abilities for Andromeda's Edge differ in power level too greatly (i.e. some too strong, some too weak), and to have to large an impact on the game. In the mechanically similar game of Dwellings of Eldervale, I'm sure some factions are better than others, but the abilities (which are only unit abilities) by comparison don't seem to have an outsized impact on a player's ability to win the game.

My 1st game, I played as the Nebulon Cloudpeople and the winner of that game played as the Pulsewar Refugees. The 2nd game, I played as the Pulsewar Refugees and another new player was the Nebulon Cloudpeople. The former has two significant faction benefits (usually draw 1 tactics card each turn, and go up on a track when losing a battle), while the other has minor benefit (get 1 of 2 basic resources, but ONLY when launching to ~1/3 of the game spaces), and a negligible benefit (move an existing ship after each launch, but with no direct effect).
Seeing these 2 factions played twice, the game doesn't feel fun or competitive because the two differ so greatly in power level. This is just one example.

In order to balance the game, it seems like either the faction special abilities would need to be changed/updated, OR players could bid with VPs or something when choosing factions, but that would unduly advantage experienced players of the game.",4,80,160,14,8.38933,388,3565,en

Edit: lowered the score from an 8 to a 7 - I'm finding more issues with the game the more I play it. The commerce track is way too lucrative for end game scoring if you are able to reach the level 2 vault this track alone can award a player up to 70 points just from the vault itself if they collect and max out their resources, which I feel is way too many points for left over resources. 
We are also finding the end game scores between players varies wildly with the winner always having a massive lead over everyone else, which never feels particularly great for the players that have been left in the dust. Ideally in games you want player scores to be close together to ramp up the excitement and to keep players chasing each other until the end of the game, but so far with this game we are finding the player in the lead that ends the game is the player that wins the game. 
Also I'm not a big fan on the game's reliance on digging for tactics cards, my gaming group has noticed that the player that grabs and plays more tactics cards wins.

143245,7.0,"** disclaimer, I was a playtester **

It's odd, this is a game that changed so much from when I first played to when we played the final rule set on a pre-production copy. Cole's written a bunch of stuff that was in progress, and I'm not going to rehash that. I think the things that really resonate with me is:

A) This is about the limits of enjoyable asymmetry in my mind. You sort of need to be able to relate to other people's factions and have a core binding element to really make a game come together. I think Vast was too far, but the common deck, battle, ruling criteria, and a common series of objectives (VP or VC card) really give this game enough gravity.

B) The game works because the factions are tested and really pretty good, but the alt-VC cards are what makes the game shine IMHO. Now you have some alternative to just performing better (which is the problem with most VP race-style games) and that this creates this whole other thing to keep track of in a sub-optimal way if you're the leader is fantastic. Much better than the original cards, which was better in practice (but not in theory) than the board control alt-VCs when we first started testing. At 3p, it's positional with pitting players against each other, but more so than that, your dominance cards can actually be triggered so you're enacting this suboptimal plan for points while trying to stave off someone else scoring a dominance victory. At higher counts, the odds you control 3 out of 4 bunny spots means you're probably going to do well in points anyway or you're playing the winter map with a clumped clearing setup.

C) Related to B, I think it's a fantastic game at 3p, really pretty good at 4p, and I'd rather not play at 2p. That said, 2p beats 5+ because the downtime is brutal in my opinion. The game is setup mechanically so that it bottlenecks the decision making process to the beginning of your turn more often than not. In particular, the Eyrie suffers from this as a programming faction. It's not bad necessarily, but does limit the player count. Some of that is just preference (and my lack of interest in downtime), some of it is just how it is.

The production is fantastic, everyone at Leder should be really proud of this effort. A solid game.",4,60,90,10,8.07114,1599,22219,en

 I went along my business while they got caught in tussles, keeping each from taking the ultimate win and that left me enough time to get the points needed FTW. Still it was close at the end and I was in no way playing optimally.

LIKE: An amazing and well-designed system of asymmetric powers, but felt very balanced. I enjoyed how fighting was not largely a turtling-up affair, but rather players must confront one another quickly to maintain their tribe's abilities. I also enjoy the juxtaposition of cute woodland creatures fighting a fierce war.

DISLIKE: Keeping track of asymmetric powers and trying to remember each opposing player's powers is difficult-- especially first time through-- which is expected, but yet frustrating when a surprise ability is revealed. Additionally, there are quite a few small, forgettable rules that get overlooked occasionally. Furthermore, the dominance cards cause the game to drag a bit, and some crafting cards felt dull.

OVERALL: This is a well-designed game, but overall, I am not enamored with combat games. Luckily it's a hybrid so attacking is not the sole focus. I usually compare these games to Antike, but I like this more because the asymmetric powers are very interesting.",4,60,90,10,8.07114,1599,22219,en

True, one player *will* make a sudden rush to the end game and if players are not aware of the potential scoring by opponents, a player will dash to the end. But I believe this is only a concern toward the end of the game - like the last two rounds of play. Up to that point, the asymmetric (really) games are for the most part, straight-forward in execution, smooth with integration and fun!

adebisi,7.0,"A prime example of how deceptive looks and theme can be. Judging from the apparent cuteness of the game you expect something suited for families. This is not the case, however. Root is a full-out war game from the confrontational end of spectrum and you need to have the stomach for seeing your game to crumble into pieces when others come and hit you hard.
 
From design point of view, I can only take off my hat. I really like to total asymmetry of the factions. It really must have been hard to balance them with so many things that could go wrong. This asymmetry also means that the factions play totally differently. As of this writing I have not tried them all, but judging from the rules and having seen others play them, there are big differences in the fun factor (of course “fun” is a subjective thing, I admit that much). Some factions play a really traditional build and expand type of game without too many surprises while some others get to mess around and come up with really surprising solutions to each situation. But do not get me wrong here. All factions offer fun, because the game itself is fun. Would suggest myself (for experienced gamers).",4,60,90,10,8.07114,1599,22219,en
adel9591,7.0,"There is so much to explore in the world of Root. With the released content you could play a game every week for the rest of your life and each one would be unique. I love how drastically the game state can change between turns, though some will find this a drawback. 

It is tough to teach. Basically you have to teach games equal to the number of players to everyone. The factions also appear to be deliberately imbalanced. That is a huge drawback for me. Things get swingy fast and there's always a pile on the leader toward the end. Whoever is in second or third for most of the game usually wins. 

Compact game though, it's very pretty, very contemplative. Very fun. ",4,60,90,10,8.07114,1599,22219,en
adelfaidah,9.0,9 but with caveats. For the love of god get a group that is consistently going to play with you. I've been teaching this game to new players every single time and its just not that good of an experience at least for me. I would rate it a 6 if not for the fact that I know it shines with a non beginner group of players,4,60,90,10,8.07114,1599,22219,en
AdelinDumitru,10.0,"There seem to be distinct design philosophies when it comes to ensuring that a game is replayable. Most common is to have variable setup, where tiles or cards change from game to game. Another popular one is to have players run such a tight ship that they cannot possibly pursue all the goals that they want in a single play. Less common, but one of our personal favorites, is to offer a sandbox experience, in which players have lots of strategies to try – the challenge here being to make the options that you can take interesting. Last but not least, and perhaps the most difficult one to pull off, is to create a game where replayability derives from player interaction, from how they react to each other’s strategies, from how they bounce tactics off each other. 
While Root features multi-use cards, what it excels at is implementing the 4th design philosophy mentioned above. Because the urge to return to the woodlands of Root stems from how each faction plays out against each other. The adorable artwork and the lovely to handle wooden pieces are also a big factor, but the heart of the game is how in time you get better at managing each faction. Until the moment where you face off a new faction, with a radically distinct playstyle. Time to change everything you thought you knew about how to play Root and approach the game in a whole new fashion. 
Sometimes you feel that you have a desperate struggle ahead. The Eyrie lost every single game, whether they faced the Marquise de Cat or the Alliance. Until we learned how to play them the right way, how to take advantage of the fact that they are the faction with the highest potential of pumping up victory points. When that happened, the mighty Cats were defeated. But who knows what the next confrontation will bring? There were plenty of opportunities for the Cats to block the inevitable expansion of the Eyrie. But being too preoccupied with protecting the Keep led to a turtling strategy which proved flawed. We’ll count that as a lesson for next time. 
At the end of the day, what Root offers is a continuously-expanding learning experience. And that’s why it’s great “even” when it’s just the 2 of us. Review copy by @ledergames.",4,60,90,10,8.07114,1599,22219,en
Adelino660,7.0,"I own a copy of this game and all the current expansions. I have to say that this game requires a significant amount of investment from the people you will be playing with. It takes a massive chunk of time to explain the rules to players otherwise new to this game. If you have other friends who have played the game before or own the digital copy, I think the barrier to entry for this type of game is quite hard for me to recommend. If you have friends who have the patience and like this kind of game, go for it. I enjoy the different factions, but other than learning how to play them, the game itself isn't all that nuanced once you know how to play it and get familiar with it.

adi_venturer,10.0,"Cole Wehrle is one of my favorite designers, and this game is a big reason why. Kyle Ferrin's art brings this game to life and makes this game a highly immersive experience. Root was my second ""gateway"" that took my participation in the hobby from the occasional play of Catan/Splendor once every three/four weeks, to taking a deep, deep plunge into the world of strategy-heavy board games, so it has a special place in my heart. 

Even though people are very divided about this game, it still remains, many years after its launch, one of the best selling games at stores every year. You can appreciate the mass appeal - the theme is very inviting and the artwork is beautiful. But what's hiding behind the whimsical woodland critter theme is a sinister war game. And it is this dichotomy that makes Root such an evocative experience. Then you turn to the mechanics - I am yet to experience another game with this level of asymmetry. Root's core set of actions in itself could make for a tight war game, but you add each faction playing its own unique (and highly thematic) game, and think about how all these games come together in a highly interactive experience, and you begin to realize what a masterpiece in design this game truly is.

But that's just what you see on the surface - after you've played your first game. There is so much more depth to this game beyond that. Root is punishing, has a high barrier to entry (5 plays IMO), requires a lot of player interaction, involves king making, and will leave you with a sour taste in your mouth when your best laid plans come undone with another player's single, strategically played turn (the Favor cards usually). Many people will not like it for those reasons, but those reasons are exactly why I love this game! The wide range of emotions this game can invoke in people, and how quickly those emotions can turn and change during a single session, is amazing and a testament to how well thought out this world Cole created is. 

I want to elaborate more on the accessibility of Root. Root was not designed to be approachable or accessible, it was not designed for people looking to sample games and move on. Root rewards you more the more you play it. I would compare it to Chess. Your first game of Chess would most likely suck. But if you decide to stick with it and play more you'll become better and the game will become more enjoyable. Root works in the same way.

The digital version of this game also warrants a special mention, and I highly recommend it as the best way to learn Root. I absolutely adore the soundtrack and the animations!

4x scalper,7.5,"A good game I'll give a 7 primarily because of the luck factor.  Not a fan of luck in games however this is more of an activity of builing your tableau based on what you can get your hands on. Yes there are ways to mitigate this factor however there are times you can't get a combo strung together fast enough to counter the the player(s) that are fortunate enough to do so early. And yes there are so many strategies you can string together to combat others that may seem as though they have the powered cards yet still squeak out a win. But again, the luck of being able to create a food machine, a bird card or bonus card machine, egg laying machine, or having to rely on the bird feeder most of the game requires a constant churn to stay in the points race. This I do like but can not take this one any more seriously than a 7.

aaj94,6.0,"Somehow I've accumulated only 6 plays of Wingspan since purchasing it, but it feels like it's been around forever. This is a trademark Stonemaier game in that it's mechanically super polished, but maybe a little uninteresting for it? Don't get me wrong, Elizabeth Hargrave has designed a real winner, and it's no surprise it's blown up like it has. The game is beautiful, decently accessible, and really characterizes a new wave of board games where aesthetics are prioritized just as much as mechanical game play (In my opinion, this is a needed course correction in the industry, so I'm definitely not complaining!)

That said, I don't know that Wingspan has ever blown me away. The people who think it's just a pretty spreadsheet are definitely wrong, but they are right in so far as the game's peaks are capped. ""A good time collecting birds"" is a perfectly delightful game to have on my shelf, and I'm happy to continue to own it. I'm especially happy to introduce it to players who have maybe tried Catan, and are interested in dipping their toe into more modern Euro-style board games. 

By the other side of the same coin, Wingspan will never approach the emotional heights of [thing=42][/thing] or even [thing=194879][/thing]. Games that consider psychology, player interaction, and 'reading' the game state -- as well as the other players around the table -- will always bear more lasting interest for me than games that are about optimizing systems on a personal player board.

Other games of comparable weight and nature would be [thing=199792][/thing] and [thing=231733][/thing] -- I don't think any of these three are in danger of being 'fired' by the others: they all feature drastically different window dressing, but all fill a similar medium-weight niche of Euro-style games that are pretty open and approachable (compared to, say, [thing=84876][/thing], which is not much more complex, if at all, but much more difficult to convince new players to take a chance on).

All in all, I will continue to accumulate plays of Wingspan. In time, maybe after 20 or 25 plays, I'll decide I've played in the bird's nest enough, and trade it for someone new to experience :)

The caveats, of course, are that the large deck and luck of the draw means it's unlikely you can consistently apply any sort of long-term strategy, and little-to-no take-that mechanisms means that at no point are you under any illusions that you're playing anything more than multiplayer solitaire, apart from the odd glance at your opponents' board state for tracking progress towards end-of-round objectives.

100pcBlade,7.5,"You would be forgiven for thinking it’s easy to design a top selling board game these days. Step 1 – acquire the licence to use the IP of a classic book title that has recently been made into a ‘blockbuster’ movie. Step 2 – take the most common design elements of the modern era and add them all into the melting pot. Step 3 – add some plastic miniatures. Step 4 – releases some expansions. No wonder Dune Imperium has rocketed up the BGG charts in the last 18 months. Of course, if it was this simple then I would already have released my own roll and write game entitled Wuthering Heights with 3” inch miniatures depicting Heathcliff and Cathy – and followed it up with the sequel “Cathy Comes Home” featuring an even bigger mini of Kate Bush

However, Dune Imperium is an excellent example of how good design can turn a few basic concepts into a very good game. It is full of difficult choices. Where do I want to send my agents? Should I send them to the Bene Gessirit to gain influence and get intrigue cards or should I send them to Sietch Tabr to harvest that Spice that I desperately need? But if I use that card to deploy my agent, I won’t get the 2 persuasion I needed to get the card that I really want. So which cards should I hold over to my Reveal action? But I also want to win the combat as it is worth a vp and an influence with the Fremen, but that means I need to find a way to get more troops into my garrison but I only have two agents and ……

In a way it’s a shame that the game is about gaining vp’s. Understandable given its nature but it’s in an example of where the theme starts to feel a little pasted on. I’m pretty sure Paul Atreides didn’t spend all his time out in the desert drugged up on Spice thinking about where he was going to get his next vp from.",4,60,120,14,8.42282,1087,14387,en

AbyssinianSon,10.0,"An excellent worker placement/deck builder hybrid. Gameplay is very smooth and there is a constant sense of tension throughout the gameplay. The only reasons I have not given this game a 10/10 are:
1) The board art really drabs up the look of the game 
2) The theme, although present, requires much more effort to see within the game. There are several times that my mental process was ""Ill send this guy here to get higher on this track and get a cube for this..."". Part of this is rooted in the mechanisms at play since they don't allow for as much design space as say the original Dune board game which imo is an inferior game mechanically but is much more thematically ground and brings the world to life better.

Achire,2.0,"Agonizing first play experience. I immediately sold the game and would never play again. Our game was so endless that my friend managed to play Terraforming Mars (with expansions) while we played this... and when he returned, we still had plenty of game left. We eventually just quit the game because none of us wanted to play anymore. We checked the remaining cards and the game would've definitely ended with the deck running out, which takes ages. Even if our game's length was some kind of unusual anomaly, I still hate the game. (1) It's incredibly boring. The cards are mundane 'go here'. The action spots are basically all 'get water/spice/silver'. The cards you buy are equally dull and there's no combo-chaining or any of the other stuff that makes deck-builders fun. (2) For all the talk of this being deeper than Arnak, I found the decisions actually much easier to make; it's a shallow decision space (3) Intrigue cards vary from nearly useless to incredibly powerful. Much of the game ends up being determined by a random draw. Overall: I wish I could see what others see in this game, but I just don't. It is infinitely worse than deck-builders like Clank or Quest for El Dorado, much less fun than Arnak, and certainly nowhere near as deep as most worker placements. War, the best part of this game, is far better done in Blood Rage or Inis, which I'd both highly recommend.

LIKE: Fighting for each victory point was fun, as a lot of point grabbing was timed to what others were doing. I liked buying new cards to add to my deck and I liked the worker placement spots. Adding the area-control for rewards added some interesting pressure to opponents. The tug-of-war over the track points was not too appealing, but interesting.  I also enjoy how one good hand, in late-game, can give a player a boon of points. 

DISLIKE: Managing the deck-building aspect was difficult for me, I sometimes get frustrated by the randomness. I had a game where this really hurt throughout the game, and it dragged the game too long for me. The intrigue cards, another random aspect, seemed quite powerful. A second game confirmed those intrigue cards can truly swing the game. I can live with it, though.

OVERALL: I don't normally agree with the masses, but this is a very good game, with good interaction. This game really needs at least one play to figure out how to feel the interaction, and how to manage the swingy flow between rounds. I'm still a bit lost on it, not really sure what to do next time.  Comparisons to Lost Ruins of Arnak are warranted, but the emergent play between the games is very different. A giant miniature worm could have helped spice up the game, but I wouldn't hark-onnen-it.

UPDATE: I had a slow 4-player game (w/ both expansions) where I felt behind the entire time, and the end result was a soured experience. I think a slow game is player dependent, but I also feel the game is marred (IMO) because of the high randomness and the length of time it takes to play. Still fun, but best when played fast.

UPDATE: The family ""atomics"" used in the Immortality expansion can easily (and recommended) be used in the base game.

aeoncub,8.0,"I am lucky enough to have a playgroup that have been introducing me to deckbuilding games over the past few months. Being really only a magic:the gathering player since 1993, deckbuilding is one of the only places where I can practice those skills in board gaming (there are exceptions, of course).

Dune Imperium was crunchy peanut butter. The added variable of choosing when to go to places where you could send some troops from was interesting. The game at first is so open, it’s really hard to do choices in the first few turns and some powers / abilities are so incremental that they may seem insignificant at first, like gathering water when you can, or when to use your ‘go anywhere’ base card. But as the turns went on and your early choices specified you into a direction, the game kind of opens up again. I understand why this is so highly rated. It is a little less fun and more groggy than ruins of arnak or clank:catacombs and is overwhelming at first, but out of all the deckbuilding games, I feel this one is the one that will require the most skill and thought.

Even with the aforementioned slugginess, the game feels like it has very little to improve and is deep and rich with various ideas, strategies and possibilities. Definitely worth the play.",4,60,120,14,8.42282,1087,14387,en
aeonphreak,1.0,"Ah, Dune Imperium. Oh, I really wanted to like this game. I enjoy the Dune IP so I had to really work hard to separate my bias since of course, based on the theme alone, I would want to like it. Initially, I did like it. However, I couldn't ignore it's glaring flaws.

Dune Imperium is another one of those modern day games where every action is rewarded and leads to the same outcome, regardless of what you do. Hence, ""the illusion of choice"" as I like to put it.  As every action is rewarded, nothing you do really matters. Hence, the game is designed to rubber band players for a close finish where the end game devolves to luck with best drawn intrigue cards.

-Have troops available? Try your hand at the conflict and gain an influence point. 
-Have a surplus of persuasion points? Just pass early and buy a,""Spice May Flow,"" card to collect an influence point. 
-Have diplomacy cards? Boost yourself on the alliance track and get a point.

The illusion of choice here creates a disguised, bland strategic experience.

The luck element of the game is poorly implemented through the use of the intrigue deck. I have no issue with luck implemented in games if it can allow a player to employ a clever strategy as a result. However, this game dumbs it down to, ""Let's pull the lever on the slot machine of the intrigue deck and see if I hit that 777."" Simply milling an intrigue deck for game breaking cards does not equate to strategic play that's fulfilling as a player. As a result, this game can be rather swingy, unjustly. 

Additionally, the mid through end game strategy devolved down to be the same for all players: Let's hoard 6 spice and see who can be the first person to place their agent on the heighliner board space to deploy 7 troops EVERY SINGLE TIME. You'd be a fool not to place an agent on this spot for the Space Guild.  Compare this board space to the Emperor's conspire board space, and it really pales in comparison. The Emperor's conspire space allows a player to spend 4 spice and acquire 5 wealth, 2 troops (which you can't deploy), and an intrigue card.  Thematically, the Emperor has access to Sardaukar terror troops and you mean to tell me that's the best he can do? The Heighliner spot is clearly the best space in the game where players would want to ensure they can go as often as possible.

Let's face it, the graphic design on the board was lazy, and a completely missed opportunity.  

The game is light on player interaction. The combat is uninteresting. You could slap any theme on these game mechanisms. When it comes to the Dune theme, I'll stick to the Avalon Hill classic.  Further, when it comes to deck building + worker placement/area control, I'll take ""A Study in Emerald"" or Legends of the hidden Arnak any day over this.",4,60,120,14,8.42282,1087,14387,en

The battle does seem to be to the center of the game. Choosing when to fight and how hard to fight can be critical. To that end, having a hand of intrigue cards can be very useful.

The alliance tracks were ok, but felt a little tacked on. It was hard to go to them, and they do reward you with points. I think I got 5 of my final 11 points from the alliances.

Afrochiapet,6.0,"In my first play of Dune Imperium I was impressed by the tightness of scoring and worker placement. However with subsequent play the skeleton of the game becomes quite apparent. 

Like many hybrid deck-builders the game doesn't quite balance card draw/utility. Without options to cycle cards the game can force you to play in fixed ways. While this isn't inherently a bad thing, the game length can drag, especially if you have to use similar strategies just because of the card flop. 

I also think the IP isn't well utilized. The asymmetric leaders and theme feel tacked on, adding flavor but not much in terms of unique gameplay. I was only reminded of the theme when doing things like paying in spice or drafting a character card. 

I can see this game being a hit with certain play groups, but I think it has run its course for me.

I assumed a strategic heavyweight and the many elements of luck didn't really fit into that.

Despite the great theme, I wouldn't call the game super thematic, but that's to be expected with a mechanics-heavy Euro. The game borrows mechanics from other popular games like Ark Nova, Everdell, Revive, Nucleum etc. It's a tableau-builder with elements of worker placement, resource management, set collection, engine building, and a bit of action chaining sprinkled in. The ruleset is not super complex, and while the listed playtime is entirely inaccurate, the game doesn't feel like a drag. The closest comparison for this game would be Everdell and I think this game is much better. The game does heavily depend on the cards, and there are cards that are strictly better than others, so you have to keep that in mind when you play. I'd be happy to play this game more.

I really like the magnetic captains sitting on one of the workers - stellar!

Play time is going to be a bit long because you constantly want to parse the Wilderness cards.  In addition, every action is critical so you want to think through what you're doing.

A little random because you're at the mercy of the cards you see.  I wish there was a way to top deck cards.

The captain powers provide all of the asymmetry (in the base game).  I think I would have liked some private, hidden goals in order to make the end game scoring a little more mysterious.

Anifer15,8.5,Major Everdell vibes mixed with a little Ark Nova. I love all the different animeeples which are superb quality- no surprise there coming from Bad Comet. It's so satisfying putting your Captain on your animeeple and hearing the magnet click. Thats a pretty cool feature. I wanted to back this on KS but was on the fence thinking it would feel too similar to other worker placements in my collection. I had the opportunity to purchase it from a game store and I'm so glad I did. This company is on a roll with their games. ,4,40,80,14,8.09712,510,3830,en
anim8r,8.0,"This publisher's LIFE OF THE AMAZONIA was not only one of my favorite games from last year but will probably also make it in my top 10 of all-time. Needless to say, I was very excited about this and it did not disappoint. TERRAFORMING MARS was just too ugly for me and I never played it a 2nd time,ARK NOVA was similar but not as bad and I liked the theme more so I did play it a bit. However, this is my perfect TM / AN. A more light/fun theme, art, components (freakin' magnetic meeples!!) and a bit more streamlined. I am excited to play this more but...
PAIN POINTS:
Why is this so long? AMAZONIA suffered from the same issue, but a quicker (official) variant is easy to implement, and the game is engaging throughout. I feel the same is possible here, and I intend to try it like that next time (just reduce a trophy or two?). Hope this publisher starts paying attention to playtimes in otherwise awesome games!

Minor gripe: Loads of time reading card text due to sweeps being made all the time, and some cards feel significantly overpowered. Will have to play more times to see what combos will synergize well with each other.

P.S. I really appreciate that there are text descriptions on the cards that explain the function, rather than relying solely on iconography. It's a huge relief and saves so much time flipping through the rulebook. Why don't more game cards do this, what a timesaver.

The game is a pretty standard engine builder with a few twists that make it unique, but not terribly groundbreaking. There is some good tension in the race for objectives, but it can be offset by the huge deck introducing a lot of chaos and lucky flops for certain players (I’m particularly worried about the recharge card that gives points for hatched eggs since it has been the linchpin of every winner’s tableau so far).

I also have one expansion, but haven't tried it yet. Really looking forward to playing this again, maybe with more players. I think it will last longer with 3-4 players, but I don't think I'll mind bc it's so nice to look at, and there's a lot of thinking you can do at your ""down time"". 

I associate the creatures with pokémon, and the exploring with Narnia or something like that. Really cool game!


Update: Played one more time with 3 players. Would say it makes the game more thinky, because now you start to pay more attention to the other players as well. Some of the rounds we got stuck in analysis paralysis and the whole game took 3h or so, but we had a lot of fun! Looking forward to playing it again!

cbazler,6.5,"This borrows a lot from Everdell: worker placement + card play, retrieving workers (advancing the time track), public objectives, even the little meeples riding animals are similar. Card combos can be quite powerful here and overall this feels a bit ""meatier"" than Everdell. I like a lot about the game.

The ""egg economy"" and board placement are new here, and they're fun... for a while. But my biggest complaint is that the game is just way too long: no way I could see this finishing in the ""40 minutes"" listed on the box, even with experienced players. We actually stopped playing halfway through because we had both maxed out our egg track and felt like the game might go for another hour. 

The problem is when you spend your eggs, you can't reuse them for another objective (unless you flip them back), which really guts your engine and makes the game drag.

Cedric_W,6.0,"I was so hype for this game, especially as the theme looked so fantastic. I got the kickstarter captain pledge with upgraded components. But in the end Wondrous creature is not as good as it seems. It took me a little  to put down the pro and cons, before deciding myself to sell it.

Cons:
- Achievement cards are just boring
- Trophy representation is dull and not in line with theme, just a stupid Trophy cup. An idea to replace the Trophy could be minerals stone for example. 
- Scoring track should be printed until 100 on the board; yes there is token to represent 50 and 100 points but you end up above 150 points usually so why not directly print until 100.
- Magnet to attach captain is not used for the game, just for the component. Everybody praise this, I find it useless. 
- the game just feels like running after points, not discovering uncharted island
- Eggs can be refreshed... Hatched, unhatched, hatched again... Makes no sense... Especially as you find mammals eggs... Should have used something else. Why not vials, and say it is samples from the flora. Then you could decide to release it or resample it at will. 
- there is just no insert... For such price this is unacceptable. Fortunately you can 3D print a fantastic one (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6831575). 

Pros:
- Cards are fantastic, illustration beautiful 
- Cards turn over is great, allow for refreshing easily. 
- Meeples are fantastic, each different to match each captain. And made of wood. 
- Rulebook is clear and easy to read- Solo is good with different difficulty level (until you figure out how to block the AI that it gets not achievements) 
- Double layered board player is fantastic

Unfortunately, that was not enough Pros for me for such pricey game...",4,40,80,14,8.09712,510,3830,en

chaddyboy_2000,6.0,"I hopped on this game because I love:

- Games with gobs of unique cards that allow you to build an engine. Bonus if the cards use a tag system!
- Games with variable goals/scoring conditions.

So, when I saw it had these things, and also that BGG users were already loving it, I had to give it a try!

I enjoyed the game well enough, but in the end, a few things keep it from being at the Terraforming Mars or Earth level for me (two of my all-time faves).

1) The goals are rather boring, mostly focusing on getting a bunch of one or two types of tags. Due to the way the goals are structured, this is going to be the case every single game. Also, due to the large amount of points for scoring these goals, all focused on tags, the tags of the cards are of primary importance, whereas the actual abilities the cards gave you felt a bit secondary. I'd rather have it the other way around.

2) The map system for gaining resources felt a bit stale, with the map always having the same go-to spots if you want a bunch of a certain resource. I didn't love this aspect of the game.

3) I just don't see any possible way this plays in the stated amount of time. Not that I mind longer games, but this game often felt like I was repeating the same cycle over and over again... put guys on the map to gain enough resources to play cards, and repeat until you reach a goal to claim. It really didn't feel like I was building up toward a crescendo like the games I enjoy more, so the repetitive cycle got a bit boring by the end.

Still, an enjoyable game, though! It's just that, after 20+ years in the hobby, I'm now incredibly selective; I really only even try 2-3 new games a year at this point, so it really had to stand out to me to even give it a go! The fantastic artwork and components also were very much appreciated!",4,40,80,14,8.09712,510,3830,en

chicagometh,6.4,"There is so much to like in this game...and so much that is bothersome.  In fact, this game is just so much.  Beautiful and interesting, yes, elegant, no.  The cards, while each unique, are sometimes simple and easy to understand on the fly, and some are just downright obtuse.  Their power within the game is widely variable, and can be extremely frustrating, since this engine game continuously supports the players who managed a decent opening hand and got off the ground running.  In addition, it is an engine game that snowballs quickly but the game is too long for this.  You may be able to tell in the first hour that you are behind and have lost, but will have to sit for another couple hours as the leader winds the game down to an ending.  Between managing the board state, the card row, the set collection, the egg mechanism (which is neat and is a keeper mechanic, but is overshadowed easily by card play and worker placement), the in-game goals, the end of game goals, the leader goal, there is just too much bloat to make me want to come back to it.  It reminds me of Life of the Amazonia, also from this company...a clever game that was expanded to near unplayability and a play time that is double what the mechanics can bear.

ciggie,7.0,"Wondrous Creatures is a worker placement game where you put your meeples out on a hex map and claim resources / cards from the adjacent spaces. By doing this you aim to play cards into your tableau that give you various one-time, continual, or end-game abilities. You play these cards with the hope of achieving various game objectives that are primarily based around set collection (types of animals / animal habitats). There is no round structure to Wondrous Creatures and once you have placed all 3 workers you then spend a turn to recharge, which allows you to recall your workers from the board freeing up the hex spaces and activate your recharge ability cards. Once a certain amount of objectives have been claimed the game end is triggered. 

Overall I found Wondrous Creatures to be a good but not great game due to a few issues. I struggled to get my engine going where as the other players found a good combo early and took advantage of it to where many actions seemed easy for them and I was just barely scraping by. It felt near impossible to catch up once they got going. Our 3-player game took 2.5 hours with teach which was too long and I could tell almost halfway through that I had no chance given how quickly they got their engine running. Lastly, and this is a similar complaint in Bad Comet's other game Life of Amazonia is that I wish the game was more structured and ramped up quicker. Personally, I would rather a game be round based as opposed to a race to complete objectives. It would tighten the game up some and not feel like the beginning of the game is dragging as you work to build up your tableau to start claiming objectives, which then start disappearing quickly as the game rushes to a conclusion. 

Overall, Wondrous Creatures was a bit of a disappointment for me. I really like how the worker placement is done on the shared hex map, but the rest of it was mostly a miss - too slow, too long, and mostly boring set collection objectives take away from what could have been a great engine builder. I think Bad Comet did better with Life of Amazonia even if both of these games have similar problems, that one just feels a bit more fun and engaging.",4,40,80,14,8.09712,510,3830,en

domcrap,6.0,"Let me start off by saying this is a beautifully produced game!  I love the magnetic meeples and the wooden workers they sit upon. The illustrations on the cards are also nice, but no where near as cool as the meeples. Unfortunately the game experience didn't live up to the expectation for me.  To begin with, the game presents itself as a immersive thematic experience, but in the end, it's a very abstract resource conversion Euro-style game. I love simple abstract games, but I'm not a fan of big complicated abstratcy games. If I'm being asked to learn a bunch of rules, I want it to come with an immersive story.

Wondrous Creattures is a worker placement, tableau builder, resource management, engine builder.  There are some interesting mechanics that could have stood on their own. I like the way your workers are placed  on two hexes and get all of the adjacent benefits.  It gives a lot of interesting choices without too many things to parse. That was the most interesting aspect of the game to me. But that  mechanic was mixed with three or four other mechanics that diminished the experience for me. 

My favorite games don't have a lot of options, but they have interestingly difficult decisions. This game provides nearly the opposite of what I look for. There are expanding tree branches that lead to long complicated turns just to figure out what your options are.  While I like the worker placement aspect of the game, the 20+ options on the board become overwhelming when combined with all of the other expanding tree branches. When you finally figure out the viable options for your turn, there IS an interesting judgement call, but you can only get to the interesting decisions if you’re willing to make the other players at the table wait for you to parse all of the options. 

The worst part for me is that the long complicated turns are interspersed with random quick turns, which means sometimes you’re waiting 10 minutes to take a 5 second turn, and other times you’re holding up the table because you have 30-50 viable options to parse before making an informed decision.  

There is an additional decision that seems weird to me.  The game gives random benefits to players that are already doing well.  Normally one of the problematic side effects of engine builders is that they snowball; the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. So it's weird to me for the game to give benefits to players who are already doing well because of their engine. The good engine should be reward enough, and if anything, the people who did not get their engine up and running should be compensated with extra random benefits.

I’ll try it again if it’s on the table, but my preference is for a tighter game with less moving parts if I'm going to play an abstract recourse conversion game.",4,40,80,14,8.09712,510,3830,en

The two things that keep this from being an 8 or 9 for me are -
1.) The unevenness of some of the content. Certain player cards are utterly worthless, while others are auto-includes. The same goes for the scenario packs - they are not all created equal, with some falling very flat while others remain engaging multiple times through.
2.) The pricing structure. FFG looks to finally be addressing this, but it is utterly absurd that you need to buy two cores if you want to actually deckbuild for two-three players. That's on top of how expensive the content packs are, and how hard it can be to get some of them complete.

While Arkham the LCG is fun, and I've played quite a bit of it over the years - there are simply much better values for the high prices FFG charges, while still delivering mediocre production quality.

AbyssinianSon,10.0,"This game is quite possibly my favorite solo game and one of my favorite 2 player games. Now before I praise it there are a few points you should be very aware of with this game: 
1) You are buying a system not a standalone game. What I mean by that is you are buying into the card game as a whole which means you will want to (at least to properly enjoy it to the fullest in my opinion) buy a lot of the campaign arcs. The core box alone is maybe a 7/10 for me because it doesn't have as much replay value or customization out of the box as the system offers after a few additional purchases which is one of the best things the game offers. It has an rpg like sense of progression as you ""level up"" your character to face tougher scenarios and deal with the trauma they accumulate by going through this gauntlet. So that leads me to: 
2) Don't buy this game if you only plan on getting just the core box unless you got it for really cheap. The reason I'm saying this is because it offers so little in replay value and so little in the meat of the game on its own. Its a great litmus test to see if you'll want more but outside of that most people will advise you to buy multiple core sets as a result to offer some more of that deck construction (personally I don't think its necessary at this point with all the expansions out so you just might want to spend that money on expansions instead). 
3) The fact that this game is COOP makes it less of a money hog than other LCGs. You only have to buy what you want to play through (but if you choose to skip the progression order you might want that second core to be able to keep up). Competitive LCGs have the problem where if you can't keep up financially you really can’t enjoy a game on the competitive scene because you'll get murdered. 
4) Once you have purchased a few of the expansions it offers a much bigger game, much more replay value, a customized experience, and probably a money sink because you'll want to buy everything after that unless your willpower is 8 or greater.",2,60,120,14,8.1287,731,10955,en

You haven't truly experienced AHLCG until you've done a full cycle, but the core is still essential for teaching the game to new players (and for the player cards). 5/16/19: Replayed base campaign and now have significantly more experience with the game as a whole.

The major issue here is that out of the box, there is very limited deck customization and the game is quite swingy and less strategic with the inclusion of only one of each of the investigators' class-specific cards. A second core set or proxies are necessary to customize your experience with the base game by allowing you to swap out some singletons with duplicates of the some cards to improve consistency. That being said, this is somewhat remedied by the expansion model since new cards can be swapped in and out of decks.

The game is moderately complex for those not used to similar LCGs or CCGs. There are a number of symbols on the cards that can be overwhelming for newer players and the freedom to choose from among many different actions can be daunting. It is not an introductory board game.

The Nathaniel Cho and Jaqueline Fine decks are significantly more focused. The cards all build around their particular gimmicks and lend to very intentional play styles, which makes the game far more interesting and strategic. I can imagine that the core investigators get better with a second core set (or just the revised core) and some modifications to their decks, but I haven’t experimented much there yet.",2,60,120,14,8.1287,731,10955,en

agentpatman,9.0,"This is a really fun game, I think I am mainly let down by the replay-ability. The story is what makes it great but also its downfall. I own Marvel Champions and it seems streamlined so much more and more repayable which makes it more enjoyable. There are so many tokens and a lot of basic math to keep track of with all the cards, skill icons, and chaos each time you use an action that you spend a lot of time just adding. There are quite a few phases that adds fiddly steps as well, doom, clues, damage, sanity, use X tokens on different characters. You don't cycle through much of your deck so deckbuilding seems a little less fun when you just don't see it. You also have to keep track of slots of all your cards. Not to menion the resources to play them in the first place. I love the thinkyness in champions of discarding cards as resources when you really want them for their abilities. It is best to consider this game a legacy game because once you know what happens you can kind of plan for it the next time and have to up the difficulty. I don't think the cost per play is there with the core box and also a little frustrated that you have to pay to see where the story goes. I'd rather see one box contain a smaller story so you don't have to pay to play so much. There are a lot of those issues for us that we will stick with Champions, but the game itself was super fun. I would play anyones copy and maybe experience the story digitally where the cost is a lot less.",2,60,120,14,8.1287,731,10955,en

Achire,4.0,"Mar 2024: On replay of final released game, raising rating from 3 to 7. Downtime is still terrible (managed to go to a food truck and get food between turns)  and it's still under-streamlined. However, the mechanisms did 'click' together this time and I saw the relationships between different aspects and I just enjoyed the game much more. I do love the theme and that does help a lot. And the mechanisms are fun, with the chained actions making you feel clever. However, chaining is the cause of a lot of downtime, so I would be happy to play this at 2-3 players and only play with experienced players at 4p. Honestly, the game probably ends too fast at 4p anyway. I won and had only cured two patients fully. I only rested once during the whole game. Hope this comes to BGA because it'd be great turn-based as that'd skip the downtime. Feb. 2023: 3. Played prototype. Was very excited to try it, loved the theme & art, but this game is not at all for me. Downtime was painful - I took a walk, had a conversation, came back.. and only one player had taken a turn. It's not that the game wound up running long (I think 2.5h or so, including teach, for 4p), but it just felt painful to wait so long between turns - even worse when you have a 'rest' turn so you take a very quick turn after waiting for ages. The game itself has elements I really love - namely the dreams & healing. However, it does feel like several almost unconnected games... there's the city, the patients, and then the books. It feels disjointed. And there's a ton of tiny things. Like how you can cite books, or how if there's a certain symbol and you match that symbol then you heal an extra heart... a million little things. I like heavy but streamlined titles - Lacerda titles are top favorites for that reason.. but this feels like it needs some more development work. It should be noted that two of the other players loved the game and one had similar critiques about some streamlining being desirable but still felt more positively about it. And I don't consider it an objectively bad game - it's not broken in some major way or anything like that - I just really hated playing it and would be reluctant to play it again, even if just to see whether the final ruleset successfully did the streamlining.",4,60,120,12,7.96197,444,4733,en

The game  is a typical eurogame, with combos of actions. I like that there are different ways to achieve points, but they are not disconnected (as other salad point games).

I'm willing to accept it may climb so we will see after repeated plays.

After two more plays it's staying at 8 because in my opinion the first two actions ae ALWAYS goign to be the same, especially in a 3 player game. And the last two actions are roughly always goign to be the same. Also in my opinion most of the regular patients just aren't very good and are easily trumped by the end game patients.

anelisa,3.0,"Controversial? Yes, but that's why I don't give second chances anymore

I didn't like this game at all, what a pain both experiences were.

Come on, I really thought it would be an okay game, I didn't have high expectations, but I imagined that it would be, at the very least, a well-made, well-thought-out game, with a convenient score, with meaning. Besides, it's a Euro that was released full of promises.

I hated the first game, but I imagined that I could have been influenced by the moment, by tiredness, and besides, after the hype and the price, maybe the problem was me, so I decided to give it another chance, in a friendlier environment, I was rested, excited to play, with energy and boom, it was another disappointment, a waste of energy, mental effort, time and gameplay, considering that both groups were so cool.

Now, let's talk less about my experience and more about the game itself:
1- It is undeniably beautiful, the pieces, the boards, the theme, the transparent regret card, in short, it seems that all the effort was there, with a congratulations to the artist and the manual labor of production.
2- The game has exaggerated and unnecessary gears, in most of the idea actions, you will wander through the three boards (a moment for you to be very careful and not fall for the charm of the overwhelmingly weak actions that will leave you eating dust), and so, why make three weak and uninteresting boards? Why not invest in a cool central board and a significant individual board?
3- Among the initial clients, there is one that will give you an additional Freud action on the reputation track, and it is a cowardly advantage at the beginning of the game, which will progressively shoot you up in the game, if you know how to use it to your advantage, while the others are, comparatively, at a huge disadvantage for other players. 4- Simply an imbalance that makes it possible for you to score 35 points in a single play or nothing at all, if you don't pay close attention. There are several ways to score and the same person can shoot in all directions and get the maximum score in all things. It's a bit disappointing to come across something like this. There's no way around it.
5- This is more personal, but I missed more mechanics that trigger interactions between players, like the publication of theses, which the use of research between players provides benefits to the publisher.
6- This game is good for those who want to play it cool, honestly, because burning neurons with a poorly made game like this is a waste of mental energy, considering there are so many good things on the market.
7- My only correction is that those familiar with the theme, psychologists and enthusiasts in the area on duty can enjoy a good experience by getting involved with the art and the references.

Another game that I found to have some mechanical flaws, but still has its merits, is Mycelium. It is also extremely beautiful, well-made, and you can see that the focus was on paying attention to the theme, expressing the idea of ​​mushrooms, mycelium, and spores. It delivers what it promises: a light game, without much fuss, with a theme that is just right for immersion. You don't get the penalty of being fussed over something poorly thought out, because it's not that complicated and being a point-based Eurogamer is not what the game is supposed to be about.

Inconsciente could have been a thematic game focused on the beauty of the game with a better thought-out point-based game, even if it were simpler, but it seems like they wanted to force complexity down your throat, even with the creativity dissipated.",4,60,120,12,7.96197,444,4733,en

anim8r,7.3,"This was probably my single most anticipated game of the year for me, in fact for the last couple of years. The theme and the gorgeous, gorgeous art by two amazing artists made this a must-buy for me . Concepts like the transparent ‘grief layer’, and having breakthroughs in therapy with your patients to remove it are amazing unique ideas making their way into a Euro game. The moving of the ink pot on your board triggering rows and columns is just the kind of stuff that makes a Euro gamer very very happy.
I was having a great time playing the game but towards the end of it, some suspicions started cropping up in my head. As the game progressed the contract fulfillment mechanism at the heart of it all started becoming more and more obvious as the other mechanisms, like moving around the city map etc began to seem just like distractions. Contract fulfillment to me is dull and overused, and I'm concerned that with repeated plays that's what will come through as the most prevalent mechanisms with its typical play patterns. 
With only one play, this might be a bit premature, especially because I like so many things about this game. I am still very excited to play this again in the hopes of my suspicions being overblown.

Jól ismert mechanizmusokat dobnak fel benne nagyon kreatív megoldásokkal, amitől teljesen egyedivé tud válni a játék. A grafikája nekem nagyon tetszik, ízléses és letisztult. Az ikonográfia teljesen rendben van, nagyjából tippre is kitalálható a jelentésük. Egy nagyon élvezetes jutalmazó sandbox játék, amiben szinte akármit csinálhatunk.

BaBang,5.0,"I had high expectations for this game. I absolutely love the theme. And the artwork (especially with the transporant cards) makes the game look fanastic. 

But mechanically, the game feels disjointed. Part of that comes from certain mechanisms (e.g. city map board) that seem like a poorly-thoughtout expansion (e.g. easy to add to the game but doesn't really mesh well). But the other part stems from the fact that there are so many options in the game that it never seems impossible to correctly manipulate your insight board. And worst, some of those options are more difficult to grok than others... yet the end-game VP seems similar (e.g. curing patients vs publishing journals). 

From a game-design point of view... I think they had some really good options. But I suspect --- don't know --- that they found players could be denied certain worker placement spots and it would have a butterfly of negative consequences for the entire game (especially with not being able to move your inkpot to the right place). So they added a bunch of stuff to the game to give players more options. And the end result is something that feels loose, some mechanisms that feel tacked on, and some strategies much easier to implement than others.",4,60,120,12,7.96197,444,4733,en

Berezeseng,8.0,"[Parties exclusivement faites à 2P]

• Déjà, faut dire d'emblée, c'est beau et bien produit, pas de soucis c'est du 8-9/10. Même en version de base, y'a une présence sur la table. Pas du niveau du ""Secret de Mon Père"", mais ça fait son effet.
A noter le petit soucis au niveau du choix des couleurs de deux personnages qui sont trop proches.

• La notice est bien faite : chapitrage, schémas, exemples et sens logique, c'est bon de ce coté là.
Le jeu a pas mal de mécaniques mais assez peu de petits points chiants à retenir pour un jeu expert.
Et au final, une fois qu'on a fait une partie, il est pas SI lourd que ça pour des joueurs de jeu expert. On est plutôt sur du low-heavy.

• On avait un peu peur, selon le retour de certains joueurs, que le thème soit plaqué.
Nous on trouve que le thème fonctionne au final plutôt bien : les actions font sens et la sauce prend bien car les plateaux sont bien thématisés. Ce n'est pas désincarné.
C'est pas le top du top non plus, c'est assez ""vers là"" sur pas mal de points, mais je pense surtout qu'il faut avoir une attirance pour la thématique du XIX-XX, de Vienne et de l'onirisme pour que ça fonctionne correctement.
Et d'ailleurs, le nom d'origine du projet ""La Société du Mercredi"", correspond beaucoup plus à la thématique. Il est plus question de suivre l'émulation intellectuelle autour de Freud que les périgrinations médicales d'un psychiatre avec ses patients; c'est pas Dixit quoi.

• Faut obligatoirement jouer avec l'extension qui ajoute clairement un gros intérêt dans la gestion des ressources.
Le jeu est assez exigeant, destiné à des joueurs qui aiment les jeux ""velus"" et le ""toujours plus"" dans les jeux de placement.
Un joueur qui a fait plus de parties massacre assurément celui qui n'en a fait qu'une poignée.

• C'est un jeu typiquement contemporain avec un empilement de couches de gameplay qui interagissent entre elles. Ces couches ne sont pas originales, tout a déjà été vu ici et là : on dirait que les concepteurs ont voulu faire une ""dream team"" des mécaniques à la mode. Ce n'est pas un jeu ""organique"" où les couches sont fusionnés mais plutôt un jeu à ""branches"" où les différentes parties sont reliées et se déclenchent les unes les autres. Faut bien noter ça, car certains ont du mal avec les gameplay qui ne sont pas synthétiques. Le jeu n'est pas élégant donc, mais on peut pas dire que ce soit mal pensé pour autant.
Y'a pas mal de petites idées sympa ici et là dans les mécaniques mais je vais pas entrer dans tous les détails, y'a vraiment pas mal de choses notamment autour du timing et des fin de tours et/ou de manches.
La vraie bonne idée, c'est le plateau principal : avec la règle qui fait que l'on peut orienter le pion bulle dans telle ou telle direction, ça restreint les choix et oblige a réfléchir au moment où on veut récupérer ces pions. On se gène moyennement, c'est pas bloquant mais disons que ça peut faire la différence en faisant perdre de meilleures actions. La roue psychique est assez intéressante si on utilise l'extension : il va s'agit de savoir générer, utiliser et transformer ses ressources au bon moment. Ce n'est pas très contraignant non plus (c'est pas un jeu ""frustrant"") mais il faut le prendre en compte dans sa dynamique.

• Point de vue stratégique, y'a rapidement énormément de ""déclencheurs qui déclenchent des déclencheurs"", ce qui fait que le choix d'une action peut rapidement devenir brûle neurones, en particulier en utilisant le jeu complet.
Si les joueurs font pas les calculs assez rapidement (ou en tout cas, ne savent pas ""laisser tomber""), le downtime peut être monstrueux.
Par exemple, le simple fait de faire une action fait ensuite bouger ton encrier sur ton plateau personnel, l'encrier déclenchant ensuite le carnet (les emplacements à droite sur le plateau) qui est ton moteur.
Le but étant, au final, de parvenir à équilibrer et synchroniser tous les aspects du jeu pour optimiser au maximum le cycle. En fait, c'est pas un jeu à ""routes"" avec différentes façons d'orienter sa stratégie mais plutôt un jeu à ""équilibre"" : si tu néglige quelque chose, ça va pas fonctionner. Le carnet étant, à mon avis, le point le plus important à optimiser, étant donné que c'est le moteur qu'on va utiliser dans la boucle de gameplay. Et second point, il est important de parvenir à générer systématiquement des ressources avec la roue psychique de façon à pouvoir continuellement soigner les patients (ie. ""résoudre"" des cartes qui donnent des récompenses passives ou de fin de partie). Plusieurs approches restent possibles pour obtenir l'équilibre cela dit.
Faut aussi noter que les auteurs ont mis assez peu de limitations sur l'utilisation des pouvoirs tertiaires : notamment, les ""cafés"" peuvent s'utiliser n'importe quand, y compris PENDANT une le déroulement d'une action, ce qui permet de faire quelques folies d'équilibriste.

• Concernant les faiblesses, nous avons trouvé que certains aspects du jeu étaient mal utilisés : le plateau ville est sympa sans plus. En fait c'est surtout un plateau secondaire et d'ailleurs, esthétiquement il est pas ouffissime comparé au reste. Ensuite, les cartes, bien que jolies, ne se démarquent pas énormément les unes des autres (elles sont plus ou moins dures à résoudre et donnent plus ou moins de récompenses). D'aucuns estimeraient que le jeu est déjà assez fouillis mais on aurait aimé plus de dynamisme à ce niveau là. Et le point de plus négatif, ce sont les tomes (c'est une mécanique de Set Collection) : on a trouvé leur utilité beaucoup trop limitée, en tout cas à deux joueurs car ils ne scorent pas assez fort. Parlant du nombre de joueurs, le jeu est assez long et à mon avis, même si on voit pas le temps passer, a 4, c'est trop long : c'est 2 ou 3 joueurs quoi. Sinon comme d'habitude, plusieurs points auraient mérité d'être modifiés voir supprimés, le jeu n'a pas été assez poli et épuré, la faute à un temps de dev' sans doute trop court.

➤ Au final, l'ensemble donne un coté un peu brouillon, complexe pour la complexité (ça demande une réflexion plus ""quantitative"" que ""qualitative"" si on veut) mais finalement jouissif, en particulier quand on aime le thème un peu intello; un peu ce qu'on peut trouver avec les ""Museum"" de Holy Grail. Y'a beaucoup d'aspects à penser et pour ceux qui aiment avoir les yeux partout, c'est cool.
Pour le moment, on s'est fixé sur 16/20, la boucle étant plutôt à la fois fun-complexe et le jeu charmant. La majorité des jeux ayant tendance à perdre des points avec le temps, je suppose qu'au pire, il descendra à 15. D'une façon générale, 15, c'est notre note plafond pour pas vendre un jeu expert. Donc pour nous, UM est un bon jeu.

+ Components: double layered boards.

+ Each player has 16 Actions (tiles) that can be upgraded twice. The action are rather small-scale (baby steps), which results in little downtime.
+ Random common goals each round that provides bonus points for certain actions. Each player can also have up to three personal goal tiles plus achievement tiles for bonus points.
+ Hand management allow to create different strategies (that may matcch the currently available goals in the game). The available cards can be drafted in the beginning of the game.
+ Invention cards and tiles can be played for unique additional permanent effects or instant boni. These cards allow unique strategies for each player each game. 
+ Players also advance on multiple tracks similar to Terra Mystica or Teotihuacan which also grant boni. 
+ Little ""combat"", other players' meeple can be displaced but at a cost.
+ Population must be fed.
+ Modular game board for variety each game.
+ Good ""inlay"" enabling rather quick set-up (despite the many tokens in the game).
+ Good indexed rules.
+ Good iconography, clean artwork, but at first glance it may look bland/old and confusing.

# Rather abstract game but quite thematic for Stefan Feld.
# Point salad with up to 350 points.
# Complex round sequence (8 steps).

# Some luck due to tile draw, card draw, and dice roll.
# Random event each of 4 rounds (4 of 20 events are included in each game).
# Climate track is affected by the random event. Depending on the climate (hot or cold) different permanent effects are active.
# Some exploration by flipping random environment and resource tiles the map. Exploration also grants points. Players may build settlements in explored regions. Exploring a volcano is bad luck because it may destroy a building.
# Upgrading requires careful planning and experience, otherwise, some upgrades may never be used.

Alan Stern,7.0,"Begrudgingly, I like this game.  There's a lot going on and it's all interconnected.  I wondered if I was going to get squeezed at the end because I didn't have any monuments, but I was perfectly fine because I had more things in my 7 VP row.  Ultimately, I squeaked out a victory on the first tiebreak, despite lagging behind by a large margin during the game.

This looks like a civ game, but it's really all about the dice.  Had I rolled better in my last roll, I would have earned at least 4 VP more.  That bothered me.  A lot.  The dice are fickle, a cruel mistress who delights in torturing us, their adherents, by rolling three 1's when all I wanted/needed was a stupid 3 (and I only had 1 idea to mitigate them).  UGH!

A bit long.  We were 4:15 for a 3p game with 1 new player (me).  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but still a bit long.  I need to look into the solo game and see if I want to buy this one.  I will say that the insert/storage plan is EXCELLENT.

Generally speaking, I like civ games.  I don't mind dice.  However, I really don't know that I need the two together.  Unlike, say, [gameid=233247] or [gameid=25613], in Civolutions it's very hard to aim for a specific goal since your available actions are largely based on your dice roll.  Roll ""correctly"" and you can do what you want, otherwise you do what you can.  There is an inherent efficiency in using as many of your dice as you can before resetting since the reset is what advances the clock on the game.  That goal for efficiency has to be balanced against what's actually [i]worth[/i] doing since otherwise it's a waste of time and you're really just buying more time for other players to do their better things.  That's a really strange balance and I don't think I feel good about it.  I like a civ game where there is pressure and competition, but you still have a decent range of choices in what you do and how you do it.  Even though there's a lot going on here (and I mean A LOT), I don't feel like that range of viable choices is present.  Roll the dice and see whether or not you like what they have to say.

anim8r,6.0,"Love Civ-themed games, love me some Feld… what could go wrong? Well, enough for me to not quite enjoy this nearly as much as I should have. The biggest issue I had was not the complexity, but the game just felt bloated and not organized in a way that I could get into it easily. Uwe Rosenberg has done games like this where there is a huge menu of actions you can pick from like A Feast for Odin and Black Forest recently, but there is a solid organization and grouping of actions in a way that is meaningful, intuitive, and easy to filter visually. Plus, Civolution always felt like I am taking micro steps of actions towards a larger goal and needing to remember all the steps in the correct order while enduring the downtime between each step while waiting for my turn. Perhaps all this is better with 2p only… but that is not how I want to play games like these.

Awakening,3.0,"Using dice for actions works in Burgundy where each die can be used for many different things. Bad dice rolls happens sometimes. High or low rolls makes no difference.

In Civolution each combination of two dice triggers a specific action. You can play through a whole game and never roll what you need. For example an action requires 5 and 6. But if you don't roll both, it will cost you, or be impossible to do. And generally higher numbers give you better actions.

Another example: This era I want to play this card, I never get the dice I need, then the era ends. All cards require a 6 and another die depending on it's color. Just to play a card from my hand, once I got the correct resources.

Oh and the game has 18 different resources. Most of them are hidden somewhere on the map.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en

ayhansaygili,9.0,"Played 3x. All of the plays are solo, so will update this after multiplayer sessions. But for now its an interesting game. Many aspects are solid. In someways suprising and refreshing in many ways restrictive.

Lets start with the negatives. The theme. There is none. This is for me a good thing, I am not keen on narrative games, love my eurostyle games. But here it is even more thin then that. With just a little more thought there couldve been some logical theme. Now its even more thin then Tapestry. There is in no way a logical sense of building a civ. Yes there are thecs, en yes dudes who can excplore and stuff, but there is no story you can create out of it besides i was in the swamp no i am in the forrest. Once again, not perse a bad thing, but it will be for people who where expecting a civ game here. Then there is the restriction part. Game takes long. Turns feel snappy but it takes long even in solo youre looking at over 3h. Once more fine with me, but most of the time you are pretty harsh restricted in things you want or could. The dice works fine, and idea's and focus is enough mitigation, but the action are splitted in to micro actions. In a whole era with a little bit of bad luck youve installed one or two cards, advanced in one or two tracks and walked a bit here in there. So if I am out to discover and expand it will cost me a whole what actions. First bring more dudes on the map, in the early era's this will be one dude per action you took, the migrate, also just one dude, explore (this action is strong from the beginning it allows to flip everything adjacent), hunt for food. and this only if you had the right dice combo. Too many little things with very little impact. You cant use your production for food or shelter. The whole production action is only usable for some of the cards but with 18 possible productions there is little planning in there since it cost a complete action to only get one card and another to install just one card. so in other wordt sence of progression is slowpaced and too much tit for tat. There are not much of the great combo feeling of COB. 

So, rubbish? No, its one of the best games from the past 5 years. Because youre equally in it. There are tons of ways to get those points. There are many and many strategys you can pursuit. There is now way youre out of the game, you have always sense of (slow) progression and there is aways something you want to do. I love clash of civilization as a civ game or a through the ages, I love Gaia Projectish games as euro, I love dominant speciesish games as area control. This is a game where a lot of things are coming together. The rules are a breeze, the solo bot is so much fun to compete with. 

Brilliant game and as every brilliant idea, it has his flaws, and that makes it perfect for me.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en

Bastwood,4.0,"Too much of everything. The dice action selection is classic Feld, but here the problem is that you'll roll all of your 6+ dice at once and have to make some kind of a plan for each one far in advance. This results in turns ballooning from small micro-actions into long ponderous exercises where you can easily lose track of what you were actually aiming to do. Compared to other Feld dice games, Civolution not only plays much slower, but also feels much less satisfying.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en

baudot,4.0,"TLDR: Overstuffed and undercooked.

Too many actions to choose from, few of which feel very consequential in this point salad. 

When you aren't trying to salvage a plan from what the dice gave you (and what the dice manipulation allows) you'll be waiting on your turn with long downtime as your fellow players are also stuck pondering how to put an engine together. Downtime can be fine when it's the cost of the other players' decisions being relevant to your own play, but here it's just waiting. Nothing the other players did was something that I ever felt like mattered to me in a way I could negotiate with them. There were no alliances, no intentional obstruction or conflict. The other players changed the board in ways that influenced me only by exploring to reveal things. It would have been no different than if those reveals had been mediated by an events deck. It was nothing I could socialize around.

The engine building in this game is particularly unsatisfying. Many of upgrades the game offers you never actually take effect or have any use. They end up just being another color-coded collectable you assemble a couple different ways for points. With so many mechanics operating at right angles to each other, powers have triggers that frequently fail to come up. Or their power-up effects end up being trivial to the final outcome of the game. 

There's significant cleverness shoveled into the mechanics of this game - the die chart of actions is particularly noteworthy. But it never gets a chance to shine amid all the drek options the game piles on the player to sift through.

I'd assume this game gets better after repeated plays, as the players learn to tune out the overwhelming number of useless options and focus on the ones that are in reach and can help them. But after a first play of the game, I don't feel more than mild curiosity to give it another chance.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en
Bayushi Sezaru,7.0,"Civolution is Stefan Feld’s heaviest game by a good margin!
It’s Feld’s attempt at a Civilization game, where he fundamentally applies a dice mechanic (à la Castles of Burgundy) to a more complex system.
The game is a beast to teach: there’s lots of different techs (each one with three levels), all available and usable from the beginning of each game. There is a map (although with no direct player conflict), 18 different resources and quite a lot of other different subsystems at work…
It needs to be proven that a system with dice can successfully applied to such a ponderous game… but, if anyone is able to do it… it is Stefan Feld!)",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en

I think there is less freedom of action selection based on dice rolls compared to that game but I think the game does make you make difficult decisions about how to proceed in the game.  At points it did feel like I wasn't quite sure which was to develop a strategy, but I'd imagine this would be better on repeat plays.

*addendum: after 2 more plays really love a lot of aspects.  The breadth of possible actions feels like a sandbox.  The card tableau is fun to build and find combos, only caveat is that it's hard to get a lot of cards unless you specifically focus on that route.  There is luck in the dice rolls but like in many Felds there are mechanisms to mitigate it.  One of my favorite euros of the last few years.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en
Bekebo,7.0,"Ersteindruck Spiel Essen 24 nach umfangreichem, erstem Demo-Spiel war super. Nach ein paar Partien habe ich für mich persönlich festgestellt, dass mir für die Spielzeit zu viele Glückselemente (Würfel, Karten, Plättchen aus Beutel, Gunstproben) im Spiel sind und das Balacing gefühlt teilweise nicht passt. Die Glückselemente lassen sich zwar mit bestimmten Maßnahmen reduziert, aber diese sind aufwändig und müssen mit dafür geopferten Würfeln/Aktionen teuer bezahlt werden. Das beeinflusst das Spielgeschehen stark, da man oft gezwungen ist diverse Aktionen zu machen, um die Bedingungen für die nächsten Schritte zu erfüllen. Dies kann frustrierend sein und den Spaß senken, da es sich immer ein wenig umständlich anfühlt und sich nur selten das Gefühl einstellt, dass ein Rad ins andere greift bzw. die Engine zufriedenstellend läuft. Meiner Ansicht nach ein gutes Spiel mit gutem Material, das für den Umfang und die Komplexität relativ einfach zu erlernen ist. Die Anleitung, das Glossar und die mehrseitige Spielehilfe sind super. Das Thema ist eher zweitrangig und wirkt aufgesetzt, passt aber zu den sehr hilfreichen und unterstützenden Informationen, Abläufen auf den Spielplänen.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,de

Big Bad Lex,5.0,"I will try hard to be succinct with my comments here. Civolution lives and dies on the roll of too many dice. Roll badly and you will lose. In our game a player rolled 8 dice and got 1 x 6 and the rest 1's and 2's. He was hamstrung and had a miserable time for 3 hours until we called it to save his pain. People will say that this will balance out over 10 plays but in the 2020's no game should have this caveat. Factor in the random card and tile flips/ draws, this game will appeal to those who are new to board gaming and get a thrill from randomness.  

A complicated game does not equate to depth and quality. Civolution is overburdened with more mechanisms than any game needs and overwhelming fiddliness that just slows progress and momentum. There may well be 21 action options but the dice will fundamentally decide which ones you can do. Turns need to be reactive as a result as long turn planning cannot be prepared with any certainty. The mitigation options are too few and inefficient compared to the lucky player who rolls the right dots.

This has flavours of a Lacerda game mixed with old school Feld (tried and tested) mechanisms but utterly fails to capture the elegance and balance of Vital's titles. 'Point Salad; has become a standing joke for a Feld game but Civolution has slipped the leash with points coming from every corner of the table to an extent that means the game stops while you monitor and stock take VPs or you ignore other players and wait for the final add up. Neither options are acceptable.

More Emperor's new clothes where impressionable gamers are keen to appear up to a complicated challenge and in step with the clamouring masses. The reality is that Civolution is an over-burdened mess of an ill-balanced experience, all hiding behind top tier production values and wanton complexity.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en

chg21012,9.0,"Feld’s Feast for Odin. Numerous paths to victory and options for how to build an efficient engine. Ultimately, you are a little more guided than in Feast if you’re going to optimize (which is ultimately what this game is about). This sprawling point salad is full of satisfying options and engine building, with most actions feeling intuitive rather than confusing. Combine this with combo-tastic engine building, cascading bonus actions, and an underlying dice optimization and manipulation puzzle that extends the system found in burgundy, and you have an exceptional design - especially given how well all of these disparate parts are interconnected, which has always been one of the hallmarks of his best works. 

Despite the lengthy rules, most of the pieces make sense. One or two imperfections mildly hold it back - like the fairly boring inevitability of “more dice” being a strictly part of the strategy (see: every other dice placement game with an “extra dice” option ever) - and the explore and activity options feeling a little weak in early plays, this is a fantastic game that isn’t as hard to grok as other may suggest. I’m not saying it’s for new gamers but it’s absolutely doable.

Is it my favorite Feld? Perhaps not because in the sprawling ambition, some of the elegance of his best work falls away. But it’s one of his most ambitious and, for me, one of his best designs. If you like your Felds, this is a game we will still be talking about years from now.

One small note: if you’re a civ game fan hoping to find your next Civilization or thinking Feld finally came over to the thematic side, think again.

I know some people like to be tortured for 4 hours (or as I call it, 'Monday night with the dom'), but I would rather devote my time to a game that doesn't frustrate and sell it as a good time.  Some people are calling this a sandbox game.  Well, no.  A sandbox game implies that you can choose your path within a game system and be successful. Just because this game is big and offers you a bunch of options doesn't mean that you will actually get to fulfill some kind of destiny within the game system.

Yes it is big and has a breadth of strategy, but I would in no way say it is all that complicated or deserves its 4.19 weight complexity rating on BGG. The game system and tech tree are things most gamers have seen before and each thing makes sense.  The board play can be a bit confusing with the strong/weak tribes and encampments, but it isn't that difficult to wrap your head around.  Instead, the game is broad, but fairly simplistic, but that doesn't mean it generates a full game experience.  
 
And herein lies the problem with this game.   With a game this broad, I want to do all the things that the game offers you...obviously while still giving you angst.  The cards are great...I want to play a bunch of them, but instead you might play 8-10 of them.  I want my tribes propagating, exploring the map, and spreading out strategically.  Well you might have 4-6 of them out at any given time if they don't die from heat or cold.  I have 18 spots for resources...I want a bunch of resources I can spend to build things.  Well, you might collect some or even be given a few free, but you won't be developing any sort of economy.  In fact, some buildings don't even require resources to build.  The income chips are varible and separate my Civ from the others...I want to get a bunch of those so my income means something that fuels my engine.  Uh, well you might get 1-3 of those, but most will require you to make a die roll to activate.

And now the dice...I actually don't mind them as a way to keep you from doing anything you want.  But without better ways to get the ideas to change your dice, you constantly get frustrated trying to do the actions that are most meaningful to you.  The pre-constructed hands give you a path, but the dice determine whether you can take that path or not.  So that is just not fun.

Finally, while the game is long, the reset mechanism makes the game feel short.  You just don't have enough micro-turns to generate anything of meaning.  So while I appreciate the ideas of this game, I would rather play something that makes me feel like I accomplished something.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en

Chutch1035,5.0,"I love Feld games and I love Civ games. When I heard the two worlds were colliding I was excited! To be transparent, I had terrible dice rolls during the game. One roll I rolled four ones out of six. If this was a game of Yahtzee, I would have crushed it. I get the perspective of pivot based on what you have rolled, but it's also a game that really wants you to lock in on one thing and do that well. I spent so much of my dice economy for mitigating dice on future turns. I think the design is smart, but it's a bit too dice chucky for me.

cjfm27,9.0,"3 Plays (updated 12/17/24).

First play was exploratory. We used first-time setup. We ambled along and had a lot of fun. Took about 5 1/2 hours, but the time really blows by with this game. You take a TON of actions and are constantly struggling against the systems. Ended up third. Left feeling very satisfied and the group was excited to play again.

Second play was completely different! We drafted starting cards. I got out to a pretty solid start with a card that let me not pay for people on deserts (nice!). I camped out there, built a boat, a few statues, and racked up some nice end-of-round bonuses. I was out to a huge lead, but was struggling with the card-play. One of our players banked huge on placing out their people for the first age scoring, but we explored and found BOTH of the volcanoes, which destroyed BOTH of his farms. This actually was devastating for him, because he lost maybe 10 points due to this. Was kinda nuts. The first explore was accidental to kill his farm, but the second was intentional and just happened to work out in my favor. I won a big round 2 achievement pushing the green track and that catapulted me ahead. Stalled a bit age 4, and ended up second by 8 points. Very, very fun, and very exciting throughout.

My quick review after 2 games:

Civolution, if you can table it, and if you have the group that enjoys big, intense games with low-ish interaction, is one of the best games of the year. This is ""low-ish interaction"" but there IS good interaction throughout; you are racing to explore, take cards, block spaces, displace people to the wilderness, build farms, and generally outpace the other civilizations. So, while the interaction is low, it is not multiplayer solitaire, as I've seen many reviewers say. I'm sure there are ways to play to avoid other people, but that doesn't always make the most logical sense for what you need to do. You constantly feel in struggle with the game systems and other players. Game 2 revealed a lot of interesting interactive pathways. Exploring is one of the more direct ways to interact. Hot tip: don't build your farms until you know where the volcanoes are! ;)

---Third Play
I drafted the Explore upgrade card (and my first flip was to upgrade this to level 3), got a few other cards that worked well with the Mouth trait, found some really great cards that granted bonus movement (one when Procreating one when Hunting) and I spread out and managed to score about 50 points exploring. Was out to a huge lead and won by 130ish points (278, 134, 126). I had built the best engine though, and I also won 3 of the 4 End of Age bonuses. Was a blast, and my friends had a good fight for second place. 

There's definitely some snowballing in this game if you don't get a few key things going in Age 1. Particularly, getting your first Goal tile finished to flip your level 2 to a level 3 is extremely important. Next, getting the right traits built up so that you can easily play the cards you selected at start (and so you can grab those yellow civilization attribute tiles, which are essential to completing your second level. Learned a lot after my first two plays and I think this time the game blew wide open for me. Some luck involved of course. Super fun, though, throughout. Staying at a 9 for me, might edge closer to a 9.5 after more plays.",4,90,180,14,8.20956,582,4088,en

adamredwoods,7.0,"1 play / 3 players

LIKE: Very nice use of sea tiles and art, for example, one tile was a sea cave that only allowed access through another tile. Good use of the original ""disc"" mechanisms, having to upgrade the tracks to manage discs appropriately, but it feels like an original game. I like the upgrading mechanisms of the workers and how their abilities increase.

DISLIKE: Too easy for some parts, one player noted the game does not scale, so 3 players may be too loose. At 4 players there will be more competition for dive tokens and conservation areas. The game is a bit of a table hog, if the full 5x5 tile matrix is filled. One player thought there should be a way to flush the journal cards. Another minus is the high amount of icons, yet no player aids.

OVERALL: Pretty fun! But a bit easy, too. It's a mid-weight game. The player-to-player interaction was somewhat low. I also felt the ""sonar"" action was too weak, as another player could dominate with conservation and diving actions alone. Late game we had to slow down the leader by not choosing conservation zones, but it ended up hurting us all. There was a bonus mission that emphasized level-5 sonar, I think that could balance out that depth-track and travel action better. Otherwise, I'm skeptical that the game has longevity, due to low player interaction and tension.

I wonder if a tighter variant would be to give each player 4 secret journal cards. When fulfilled, a player would get a new card. This way the options and planning are tighter, rather than being open an loose. I would also maybe play with dive tokens face-up.

adi_venturer,9.0,"This is probably my bias towards the theme talking, but I love this game! Firstly, as a scuba diver, it makes me very happy to see a Euro game where so much thought has been put into the theme. Instead of just painting it on, they decided to use it as a vehicle for messaging about ocean conservation. When I try a game - regardless of whether it's designed to be thematic or not, I try to understand what story the game is trying to tell. And Endeavor: Deep Sea gets high praise from me in that regard. You play as crew of a research team, and all your actions either help you increase your knowledge about the ocean, or they use the knowledge you have gained to directly help the ocean through conservation activities. It's brilliant and I am here for it.

Mechanics-wise, the game features engine building, action selection and action chaining, the latter two being my favorite Euro mechanics! 

It is also pretty incredible how the same game system is adaptable to competitive, co-op, and solo play, where each variant feels so different. It's great game design! I know that most people don't like the co-op variant, but I actually quite enjoyed it. I also had a blast playing through the missions solo, albeit some of them are considerably harder than others. The solo mode also features heavy luck-based swings in the bonus goals, since some of them are much easier to accomplish than others. This still didn't get in the way of my enjoyment though. 

This game has become an instant hit with all my gaming groups and I expect to keep going back to it.

I had the chance to play with a deluxe edition copy, and I loved everything about it. The most outstanding aspect for me is how deeply thematic the game feels. As you explore locations with an ever-improving crew, you can venture deeper into the sea, and the board literally darkens as you go—it’s incredibly atmospheric!

In true Eurogame fashion, the game is packed with meaningful decision points throughout. Choosing which zone to explore, which crew to recruit or upgrade, deciding on the best actions to take, and plotting your movement—all of these choices feel impactful and engaging.

The locations themselves are diverse, which adds to the replayability. Even a single mission feels fresh due to the thrill of discovering new places, but the inclusion of multiple missions is the icing on the cake.

The production quality is top-notch, from the components to the flawless insert. A big congratulations to the creators—I’m so glad this edition exists!",4,60,120,10,8.23881,438,3590,en

anim8r,8.5,"I had played the original Endeavor just once and quite a bit of the much improved Endeavor: Age of Sail with a facelift and a lot more stuff added. I enjoyed the core mechanisms quite a bit but eventually got rid of it because the theme always felt unnecessary even though the AoS had a decent approach towards it.
This new theme and setting is perfect— I would say it feels like a very much new game that shares some mechanics with the Endeavour series. Not only is this new theme not offensive/ unsettling, but it is also a net positive in theme and thematic gameplay. Player interaction is still there, but it feels more positive than negative. It is not an overblown table-hog like AoS was either which is great (though it comes in a bigger-than-normal box for no good reason). I also felt AoS ran a bit too short to justify the sprawl of the game but Deep Sea is a bit longer, but in a good way as it feels more substantial. I can see this moving up a tier with more plays! Happy to see a publisher’s endeavor to improve/retheme a game seems to have actually paid off! (unlike Mombasa Skymines etc ..fingers crossed for Santa Maria Saltfjord )
Pain Points: The art, especially on the character tiles is a little meh for me and tonally a bit too flat and dark. A little more vibrancy there along with some art on the cards would make the game have a better visual impact. That and the larger box size is the only thing I can complain about… and I am being nitpicky.

apatheticape,9.0,"9/10 based on full 3-player demo game and one solo game of prototype on TTS. Will update rating when I receive and play the final game.

ETA Jul 26 2023: Played 3 more times solo. This is a really good one folks. The wait for the final copy is gonna be a long one. Super smooth streamlined system that's easy to pick up and understand. Will play 5 which is rare enough for any decent game but should run quickly enough to work at that player count. Lots of great tactical change-ups in the multiplayer - it's a constant race for this or that element that you need or to meet the end game goals. In my 3-player demo game, the diving areas were scarce leading to everyone aggressively hitting them and shortages for research happening if you didn't get to them fast enough. This was a rare case from what I was told, but it illustrated how dynamic and interactive the game could be.

Hitting the next levels in each track is just super satisfying and drives mini-arcs in the game where you're often striving to just get over the hump to the next level on a certain track (i.e. get next level specialists, get an extra disc, or get an extra disc back) before the end of the round so you can benefit and chain something else.

I think this is gonna be a huge hit for that mid-level gamer, it really hits a sweet spot of lots of depth for relatively little rules overhead.",4,60,120,10,8.23881,438,3590,en

Since there's less places to need to race to, there's also no opponent thwarting your plans, which means you can mostly optimize your turns in a vacuum.

Still, there's a lot to like in this version since the logistics in this new version are more interesting, as are the number of choices you can make on your turn. Some excitement is brought back though by exploring new ocean tiles.

The solo mode is brutal.  After my first game I’m not sure I’ll attempt it again because I didn’t even come close to clearing Beginner difficulty. The coop goals seems a bit more reasonable. I’m sure I’d get better at it, but combined with the simplicity, the brutality of the solo does it no favors.

This will be my new Endeavor to play with folks who haven’t played the original. I’m glad I have both!

Quick edit: wanted to mention I liked the simplicity of the coop solo mode, I just wish they hadn’t gone the Brutal route. I did get one rule wrong that might help close the gap a hair, but I can’t imagine it would do me that much good. But I look forward to giving it another shot someday more than before. 

Also, I wanted to mention the art. A lot of folks complained that some of the art is too dark. But I think it is a smart middle ground between the bright top art and the darker deep in the sea art. I think they knew what they were doing here folks.",4,60,120,10,8.23881,438,3590,en

Definitely an improvement over the original Endeavor, and a welcome move away from its distasteful colonial theme (no slavery!). I love the addition of the exploration aspect and the art and production are jaw-droppingly gorgeous.

The core idea is so fun: you need reputation to level up your abilities (and access to actions), discs to be able to use the actions, coordination to be able to clear away previous discs, and tech to be able to travel farther and deeper. Ignoring any one of these will cripple you, but the order and method by which you chain and combo them will be different from game to game.

But where the game shines is actually on the communication-non-communication mechanics. It's similar to The Crew one, but for some reason, I guess because you only have 4 dice instead of much more cards, it feels so much more tense.
Playing the game is actually a journey with your partner, first to know each other, to understand why you would place or not place certain dice in certain moments, to help each other, and most important: trust each other.

And all this is done with modular-scenario-based that allows you to increase the challenge as you increase your landing skills to keep it always fresh and challenging.

1、代入感max！我真的觉得自己在驾驶飞机，想要让它平安着陆。说起来挺可笑的，我觉得最后代入感的地方就是主面板最上面两条可以推进去的插条，非常形象的模拟了距离还有高度的变化哈哈哈！行动的设计也挺有意思的，比如基础游戏中可以使用通讯让挡在自己航道上的飞机离开、调整飞机的姿态、控制引擎输出的动力、放起落架、放襟翼、刹车、喝咖啡等，都非常贴合主题。
2、虽然这游戏有一个自由交流的阶段，但是感觉交不交流都没有问题，该回合要做什么大家还是比较清楚的，但是具体能不能做得好，还是要看骰运，但是基础游戏的回合数是很充裕的，多喝喝咖啡还是比较容易过关的吧。可能由于我是网上玩的，大家嫌打字麻烦，全程无交流也玩得蛮好。
3、只玩了几个模组，感觉大多数模组都增加了游戏的难度，使游戏更富有挑战性。比较不一样的是实习生模组，增加了游戏的操作感，因为两边实习生的数字是可见的，更容易打出配合。
玩法：
一人扮演机长，一人扮演副机长，轮流放置骰子控制飞机，满足条件就可以平安降落。",2,15,15,12,8.1722,744,8811,zh

I literally don’t understand how can they make a game so hard to play. Isn’t board games supposed to be challenging, but still manageable?

Two items need both players each round - the bank angle needs dice as close to each other as possible and the speed is the sum of each dice allocated - do you need to slow down, speed up or stay steady? Each player has other responsibilities as well that soak up dice - avoiding planes, setting flaps, brakes, etc. It's a game of leading, guessing, following, knowing what each player has to do and what values might be free - and hoping they've got them.

adamredwoods,6.0,"1 play / 4 players (w/Apline expansion)

LIKE: I think the idea of pressing-your-luck for various bonuses is a nice way to play a set-collection card game. I liked the balance of the cards, and the card management of deciding what to discard. I enjoyed the theme and splaying cards and to have a central tree for tableau building. A pleasant theme.

DISLIKE: High randomness, I don't feel there was a lot of strategy other than when to push your luck. Many times I would plant a tree only to turn over an excellent card that someone else would take. At 4 players the competition for cards is high. The game felt mostly solitaire, I wasn't caring about other player's collections. Abundant iconography was intimidating, but it quickly makes sense and becomes easier.

OVERALL: I liked it, I will play it depending on the group, but not my preferred type. It's a good family game, but for competitive gamers, probably not a first choice due to randomness. The Alpine expansion was nice, rarer but stronger cards, an easy expansion to add.

On your turn you choose one of two actions. You can draw two cards (from the deck or from the faceup cards), or you can play a card from your hand. 

This minimalist turn structure tempers a rather busy and chaotic deck of cards, yielding a game that is both snappy and thinky.

Consensus from the balance police is that wolves and deer are maybe a bit overpowered at lower player counts, but I still prefer the game at just two players, because that gets me the most stuff in my forest :)

ajie426,7.0,"超主观点评：
1、没什么新的机制，卡牌管理+刷分。但是主题比较讨喜，在自己的森林中藏着一堆可爱的动物，美术不错，动物互相之间的搭配也很多，至少开个三四局都不会腻。
2、记分稍显复杂，而且没有记分轨或者分数指示物，在整局游戏中几乎没人会去算自己有多少分，终局结算才知道具体分数。这个做法也不能说不好吧，这样就不容易让人觉得自己在坐牢。
3、在bga体验的，感觉针对安卓的排版有问题，不管有几张牌，都缩放得小小的，看得很辛苦（我用的是12寸平板）。
小心得（不一定对）：
1、小动物比树稀有一点，因为理论上一棵树可以藏n只小动物（至少4只，部分小动物可以藏在同一个位置）。2、有些小动物看着很弱，比如兔子只有1分，但是打多了之后配上狐狸就很强了，不仅每只变成3分，还可以刷多多牌，如果凑出狐狸+兔子+楸形虫，那就更强了！当然，还有别的组合，比如狼+鹿，树下加强，树上加强等等。
3、一定要把握好空地刷新的时机，自己手上的很多牌都是对手想要的，但是和自己的牌型又不搭，把握住刷新把它刷走。
玩法：
到自己的时候可以摸两张牌或者打一张牌。牌可以从空地上或者牌库中摸，打牌时需支付左上角的费用。
当从牌库中摸出第3张冬季卡的时候，游戏结束，分数高者获胜。",5,40,60,10,7.70082,535,5396,zh

Alexredshoes,6.5,"Will play again because maybe a first play problem, but cadence and gameplay seems hard to grasp on first play. The distribution of cards is vital to know to avoid playing for unlikely strategies. When to try and focus on building forest Vs populating with animals and plants etc. seems there's too many turns where you are doing/ achieving nothing, and luck of the draw can play a factor in this. It's not particularly short for what it is either - an hour for a 3 player game. Having said all this it is a game that may improve greatly on a second play with familiarity of the cards, and focusing on a strategy to play cards as often as possible to your tableau, though this will leave alot to chance...

After second play: A much improved experience, aided by a better understanding of the card distribution and knowing the frequency of cards, (noted on each species in tiny writing). There's something odd about the game to me which may well be a ""me"" thing. It feels much larger and more complicated than it looks. There are a plethora of similar set collection games of this type, but this feels a step beyond those in complexity and that can catch you off guard. This comes from the amount of information/ possibilities on each card with it being split in two. Animal / plant cards have: 2 colours, 2 suits, 2 costs, 2 scoring conditions and often 2 bonus actions and/ or 2 effects triggered when played. Then consider a hand of 8 of these (max hand size 10)... The potential combinations is baffling, at least to me, and then you have to consider your opponent's tableau before paying for anything incase you give them the perfect card. Best strategy seems to be to lock on to one or two things that score in sets and go from there ( e.g. butterflies and chestnut trees), but the relative values of things still eludes me, even though I felt like I did alot more this game.

Alpine expansion helps fill it out a bit... enjoyed latest play. Really a 2 player game - there is a cadence that jars with me personally- you dont seem to get a sense of flow or building up to something- flow is interrupted by every other turns  when you have to pick things up to pay for the next thing next turn... you can never pick up and pay... maybe just a me thing but I've discovered this jars with me.",5,40,60,10,7.70082,535,5396,en

BGA Digitally it's hard to play on mobiles.
Trees can look too similar

You need the right cards and knowledge of how many, although there are plenty that it's not a big issue

You need to keep an eye on what is best and what scores best and do you draw or score, especially after the second winter.

It's not a short game and you'll need space

Obviously it's got the cute theme, the educational element is great!

andris0321,7.0,"2023 Nov:
I was surprised by how a simple deck of cards could offer a full hour of gameplay. Once you get the hang of the cards, strategizing combos becomes second nature, yet there's still room to reoptimize your hand each turn, engaging your brain in a satisfying way. However, I did notice that the decision-making felt somewhat repetitive after a while, which may not be ideal for a game of this length. The process of sliding cards under each other, particularly in a large forest setup, was a bit cumbersome, as it required constantly rearranging cards to make space for new ones. In this aspect, I believe a digital version of the game might offer a smoother experience. On a positive note, the artwork is absolutely charming!",5,40,60,10,7.70082,535,5396,en

Andy Parsons,7.0,"A very accessible tableau builder.  Player turns are a straightforward choice of draw two or play one.  The iconography is less overwhelming to newcomers than the likes of Race for the Galaxy (RftG). Having said that, the differentiation between card “suits” could have been a little clearer.

Like RftG, this is a game in which you pay to play cards with other cards.  I found the decisions about which cards to spend angstier in Forest Shuffle because fewer look useless and because spent cards become available for opponents to draft.  Denying opponents the cards they want is where the interaction lies in Forest Shuffle; there’s no take-thatery, no leeching off other players’ actions.

While Forest Shuffle’s deck isn’t huge, there do seem plenty of possibilities for set collection to explore.  This is assisted by all the non-tree cards being split in two.  However, some, much discussed, sets will always be stronger than others.  Engine building is less prominent than in RftG; this game seems mostly about increasing multipliers.  There aren’t very many cards with lasting effects.  Luck of the card draw is present, but that comes with the tableau builder territory.

Forest Shuffle’s artwork is pleasing and mostly functional, though why there aren’t ten card slots in the clearing is a mystery.  Production quality is good.",5,40,60,10,7.70082,535,5396,en

Animepops,8.0,This is a great little card based game! Cards have multiple uses as a currency and an engine builder unit. Lot's of combos and builds to chase. The art is also brilliant.

antlerflax,7.0,"7/10 based on BGG's 'usually willing to play'. I'd probably give it a 6/10 in terms of quality.

This game is gorgeous, and we always play with the Woodland Edge expansion. It's always fun when a card comes up that's useful for your tableau, but it's very hard to pivot your strategy unless the random chance favours you, and if multiple people are going for the same strategy there's no point continuing because you'll all just end up scoring less. 

Pulling off an engine that steamrolls your opponents is very satisfying, but this is really down to chance rather than skill. Last game I reached a stage where my tableau let me draw a card every time I put a card on the top or bottom of a tree, draw a card whenever I played a plant, got exponential point bonuses for each plant I owned, draw a card whenever I played a butterfly, place as many butterflies as I wanted on a particular tree, and double my butterfly points at the end of the game. Absolute madness and very funny, but I actively went in not wanting to play the butterfly strategy until my insane card draw just put the right cards in my hand in a tiny number of turns, allowing me to do it regardless. It didn't feel like it was anything I'd done myself, just the luck of the draw.

It's hard with games like this, because you can't retroactively make cards less or more powerful, but some are outright broken and all the developers are doing to fix it is buffing existing strategies with yet more cards. Butterflies were already a winning combo, but now the Woodland Edge expansion adds even more butterflies and multiple cards which double your butterfly points. This was done to combat wolves/deer in the base game, but that was a strategy you really had to build up to as the creatures cost the most out of any in the game, so already felt balanced by how hard it was to pull off. Now butterflies are not only cheap but even more powerful. I always find myself deciding ""this round I'm going to play something other than butterflies or birds"" but the cards either award too few points to be worth the effort, are too expensive compared to a cheaper strategy which offers more instant gratification, or are too rare (a frog which reqires gnat cards to crop up, and even then only gives you a measly bonus). 

Overall, it's fun, lighthearted, appealing to multiple groups (a highly overlooked factor these days), and thematic, but struggles with power creep and some strategies being far more viable than others which we're finding is really limiting replayability after about 5 games because you know exactly which cards you're looking for and it becomes a game of that. Looking at similarly themed games like Cascadia or Meadow with far more strategy, Forest Shuffle falls towards the middle of the pile of these nature-themed games which are positively flooding the hobby these days. And looking at tableau builders, something far less intricate like Sushi Go, with higher group appeal, is much more accessible.

Upcoming expansions which tweak and balance points scoring like the new one which adds more caves to the game feel too little too late, and just prove the base game had weak links to begin with.",5,40,60,10,7.70082,535,5396,en

Destroys the elegance of the original to simulate a battle, while it is still just a draft game, then abstracts battle, but not enough to make it nice.

anim8r,10.0,"7 Wonders Duel is one of the very few games that I rate 10 out of 10 with more than 55 plays! Am a big fan of a LOTR, Vincent D's art and Bruno Cathala designs—obviously so many of my favorite things coming together and not being game of the month is unlikely. This is an improvement over 7WD in every way for someone like me. The gameplay itself is more streamlined with no points just three victory conditions and I am all for it. The changes make the game feel quite thematic while still keeping it super simple and accessible. The game has been boiled down to its elegant best!
Pain points: This is less a con, and more of a wishlist. though I love the 20-minute playtime, but it is so much fun, I would not mind if there were a few more gameplay elements strategies in play and if that increased this to 30 odd mins, I would be fine. I'm super excited to see how they add to this (inevitably?) in the form of expansions.

AntOonin,10.0,"This review is based solely on this game, having never played its predecessor (at the time of its release, dueling games didn't interest me and the theme didn't appeal to me).

I was fooled by the skilful communication of the Repos Prod teams and a desire to buy the game almost as soon as the first visual of Gollum was published. And so I bought the game on the day of its release. In short, so many reasons to be disappointed when the hype is too high.

But the authors, Bruno Cathala and Antoine Bauza, have once again pulled off a master stroke, with the help of Vincent Dutrait's illustrations to enhance the whole.

Once you've assimilated the few points of the rules (I salute the clarity of the rulebook), the mechanics are so fluid that you can focus solely on your enjoyment of the game. You'll understand the significance of your card choices instinctively from the very first game, and you'll only need to refer back to the rules aid during the first few games for the iconography on alliance tokens on the few occasions when you have to select one.

Beyond the strategic aspect of card selection, there's a slightly regressive pleasure to  manipulate your units, and a real little stress/excitement in moving Nazgûl and Hobbit along the ring trail. Which brings me to the material, and for less than 30€, the box is well-stocked with, in addition to the cards, beautiful landmark tiles, coins, a (very clever) track for the quest for the ring and, above all, mini-units and towers for the battle in Middle-earth. 

The Lord of the Rings theme is superbly integrated, whether through this “Quest for the Ring” or the war of territories. If we really want to quibble (because with a boardgame of such quality, it can only be quibbling), it's finally on the card collection/chaining part where I felt a little less immersed (maybe we're just missing an Eowyn card and a Witch-king card under which to place the Races cards obtained to have more of a feeling of rallying / enslaving these races... ?). 

And for lovers of the Lords of the Rings universe, I obviously recommend playing the soundtrack in the background during your games ^^.

A real pleasure to play!

anim8r,8.0,"I was not nearly as impressed with Flamecraft as many others, but I backed this anyway as the designer and mechanisms were quite different, but the amazing art of Sandra Tang is present here too. This is a step up from Flamecraft in complexity but not really “complex” as such— which is a good thing. The best part is the interactive design thanks to simultaneous programming and competing for the very limited resources at various locations. It is always tense to see who is going to send which Chef to which location and I am here for the dramatic reveal and the following laughs and playful cursing all around the table. To say that the game has variability would be an understatement. Especially with the Critter Kitchen: À La Cart expansion (or even without it), it has plenty of variables that change things up from game to game. The scalability to higher player counts is another plus… provided the playtime does not become unbearable. I am hoping the simultaneous planning would help make this a good candidate for a strategic (non-party) high-player count game, more plays are needed to determine this.
Pain Points: While I appreciate the tons of “Zous Chefs” to pick from… having to pick from a gazillion cardboard pieces is like searching for a needle in a haystack (reeks of KS bloat). Deluxe edition’s wooden meeples better, because no way I am not storing or carrying a ginormous box for a light-ish game experience. Perhaps 3 generic wooden meeples representing the different sizes of Zous Chefs would be a more elegant and functional solution.

But giving it a 9 overall because it is a little bit fiddly in places and lots of details/rules that some might see as more than the game weight warrants. Even knowing all the rules, it's easy to miss a tiny detail that might change a star or two in final scoring which could affect the outcome. There are so many combinations of things (which is part of the appeal and greatly enhances replayability) that you may need to check the rulebook to see what to do with a given pairing of cards/set-up. When the FAQ wiki/notes are available, that'll be great (eg. I'm still not clear on what to do with gold coins cart in every situation).

dragoncrescent,4.0,"Excellent art and 'feel'. The pieces are deluxe, and the tiles are wonderfully designed. I appreciated the subtle elements, like the pips on the plates and the game screen with information.

That said, the rules are painfully fiddly. The initiative track mechanic is somewhat arcane and entirely out of your control, resulting in some rounds where you simply don't get the things you need. Or anything at all. Nothing is worse than wasting one of your meeples only to come home with soup. The objectives are obtuse, and even moreso in the final round. The Zous chefs offer a cute little pun with their designs, but the small wooden meeples are a complete miss due to their coloration. It would have been helpful if they were made of grey or white wood, or any other color but teal. 

Honestly very glad I played it. I love the production values, but the game itself winds up being convoluted and not particularly enjoyable. Would politely pass, if this was on the table.",5,60,60,12,8.02619,102,1258,en

I will also note that I am really disappointed in the insert. After many tries, I cannot escaping lifting the lid/ I cannot fully close the box. Also the part of the insert with the cards is hell to move around. The cards are sliding out from many angles when moving this part of the insert (moving it is required because other components are stored underneath this part of the insert). For the cost of the Deluxe game, I definitely expect better. As an Andromeda's Edge Deluxe owner as well, GameTrayz is racking up a really bad record.
My last note is echoing what I posted on the forum. The unboxing generated way too much trash/unused plastic bags. Going with a more environmentally friendly approach would go a long way in my eyes.

gregamara,9.0,"This game is excellent! A sheer delight to play. My wife and I have been looking forward to Critter Kitchen arriving and it did not disappoint. The two of us and our friends absolutely loved the 4-player game we played.

Pros:
+Covered in adorable art
+Fun theme
+Surprisingly puzzley
+Simultaneous actions
+High variability with Critics and Rumours 
+Restaurateurs all are puns...so many good puns
+Both short-term and long-term goals to work towards 
+Excellent moments of tension with location reveals
+Presenting your dishes is just fun

Minor Cons:
-Some elements of the scoring can be forgotten as there are lots of aspects of the game to think about. (Subsequent plays should help)
-Priority rule can be a bit tricky for players to grasp and remember, but by the end it had clicked.
-Setup and take-down can take some time (but it is all worth it).",5,60,60,12,8.02619,102,1258,en

allofthesteph,7.0,"Flip 7 is a unique and unpredictable card game that feels reminiscent of Blackjack, but with its own twist—you can use action cards to mess with your friends! The game is played over several rounds until one player reaches a total score of 200, and the strategic elements add a fun layer to the gameplay.

That said, there’s definitely a learning curve with all the different cards and rules. We had to reference the rulebook several times during our first game to make sure we were following everything correctly. Once we got the hang of it, though, it was pretty fun!

One thing to note is that Flip 7 involves a lot of math and keeping score, which might not be everyone’s cup of tea. One person in my group found it a bit stressful, while another—an accountant—took charge of tallying for everyone and loved it. So, it really depends on your mood and your group’s preferences.

I could see this being a great game for families, especially as a fun way for kids to practice addition, but I wouldn’t classify it as a “party game.” It’s a bit too structured for that vibe.

Overall, we had a good time playing and will likely pull it out again for future game nights! If you’re into math-based card games with a bit of strategy, this might be a great addition to your collection. ?",99,20,20,8,7.29928,211,1450,en

There are some special and action cards which help or hinder you or an opponent.  You can freeze at any time and bank your points.   The first person to reach 200 points wins.  The best part of the game is watching how people deal with the decision to ""hit"" or ""stay"" and the hilarity of seeing them succeed or fail based on the luck of the draw.  We loved how fast-paced Flip 7 is and gave it a solid 9 out of 10.  We probably would have given it a 10 but we struggled to figure out how to use the action cards we were dealt in the first round.  Once we figured that out, we had a blast and played multiple times.  I was a little surprised the game didn't come with a score pad since the box is big enough for one and it is required to play.

It's such a simple idea and it works, but on my first play I didn't totally feel that excitement because two of us kept busting early and allowed the other person to get out to almost a 100 point lead and coasted to victory.

4Corners,8.0,"A unique game that looks like Ameritrash but plays like a euro, set in a parallel universe where different nations are fighting for supremacy and/or busily doing their own thing producing goods, building etc (hence the term scythe and its dual purpose). The goal is to have the most money at the end of the game, and the end game is triggered by the player who first completes 6 conditions (signified by placing a star on the conditions). 

You start the game with a leader of a nation who has a unique ability and a somewhat unique set of mechs (these are the advanced technological machines of war) as well as a random player board, each of which has the same actions, but the pairing of the top and bottom actions, as well as the costs/payouts of the bottom actions are each slightly different.  On your turn, you select one of the action columns, doing the top first, then the bottom (although you often won’t have the resources to pay for the bottom action), and you cannot do the same action column two turns in a row. 

The top actions are: 1) gain power or combat cards (power is a currency that you can spend when in combat, and it’s also a star condition, and power cards are another currency that you can spend, more situationally, in combat), 2) movement (very important as you want to spread out on the shared map as there are several different regions for producing goods, there are random but good events that you can benefit from if you use your leader, and there is the central factory where you can gain a powerful extra action slot if you use your leader) or gain money (you can gain 1 or up 2 dollars (all basic abilities can be upgraded, more on that later), 3) produce (your workers will produce 1 good per worker on that hex, this is the main, but only, way to generate resources, as well as more workers (which is a start condition), but the drawback is the more workers you have producing, you get penalized each production (loss of power, money, popularity), 4) trade (pay 1 money for any 2 goods, a nice way to get those resources you really need but don't have access to), or popularity (pay 1 money for 1 (or 2 if upgraded) popularity- popularity is very important as its a star condition if you get high enough, but more importantly, it's a multiplier for your end game board position).

The bottom actions, which always cost resources, and generally pay out money after completing, are: 1) upgrade (a double benefit as you unlock/improve a top action ability, while decreasing the cost of a bottom action ability, and also a star condition for completing all upgrades), 2) construct a mech (you have 4 mechs, each with their own power that once built, applies to all of your plastic pieces (all your mechs and your leader), as well mechs and leaders can participate in combats), 2 of which if successfully won can get you stars, 3) build a building (each building has an ability, provides ownership of a hex, and is a star condition, and as well each game there is a bonus criteria for building certain patterns of buildings on the board), 4) enlist (you can receive a bonus each time you and/or your neighbor takes that particular bottom action for the rest of the game, also a star condition for completing all enlists).

The game end is immediately triggered once a player has achieved their 6th star; at this point endgame scoring provides money (to be added to the money you already have on hand, which could be significant) for each star you achieved, each hex you control (only your worker, leader, mech, and/or building on a hex), and each pair of resources you have left over (in descending order, as stars are more valuable than hexes etc); the caveat is that you get awarded coins based on your popularity, the more popularity, the better your endgame multiplier.

I was initially not interested in/dismissed this game, and as a result I missed the kickstarter.  Stupid me.  I ended up running around and eventually got everything, and I mean everything for the game.  I originally though it was pretty cool, then I thought it was too random, now with many more plays, I definitely appreciate the game and enjoy playing it.  Great components, art, design, lots of ways to play it, nice asymmetry, very fun.  This is one of my 10 year old's favourite games.  There are 3 major expansions, as well as some minor ones.  I think it's all worth getting, but the major expansions are excellent and must have, Invaders from Afar and especially Fenris are top notch.

A skinned math nerd,5.0,"A 5 might be a bit harsh, usually I'd give this game for the experience that I had a 6.

This rating isn't because of a devastating loss, I actually won my first and only play of it. But it became pretty clear that this game has a runaway leader problem, which probably has to be balanced out by the other players having to unite against the leading player. That the game manual requests that people refrain from actually keeping count of who is ahead in points and how many points are to be gained by an action doesn't help, it seems like it just wants to mask this issue. In our case, it was a little race at the beginning, but the game was pretty much decided after three or four turns, and this in part to the initial setup and the very first random encounter. After half of the game, we could have stopped, the outcome was clear and there was no possibility at all that I could see for the other player to get back into the game, without having done anything wrong himself when playing the game. The unbalanced secret goal cards probably added to this: While one of mine was a breeze to accomplish, both of the other player were rather hard to fulfill.

The game is definitely playable, as in: the game mechanics are working together, but they don't complement each other well enough. When looking under the hood, leaving all that bling (the opulent visuals of the game) behind, the mechanics seem to be tackered together so that there is just some variation and choice for a change of the game state when playing. Despite it seeming very complex at start and when looking at it on the table, there is actually very little ""game"" to be found in this one.

In hindsight, the game hints at being deep and immersive, but actually there isn't much to it. The only good thing about this is, it's actually quite easy to teach. If you want a game that is designed a lot better with a gameplay similar to this one, then I'd recommend to get Eclipse or Terra Mystica, for example. Skip this one instead.",5,90,115,14,8.12311,1808,24971,en

Enjoyed it greatly, but it did make me feel that I've 'completed' my Scythe experience. I'll likely return to it at a later date. 3/5/17: Plays very differently depending on the combination you get & maximizing your combo's potential is essential. I haven't played enough to know whether all combos are well-balanced. Fun, tense game that provides a variety of paths to victory. Beautiful design & components. Excellent streamlined engine-building gameplay. Things that keep it from being a ten: some fiddly rules that feel like they could have been streamlined, a little low on interaction for a game with combat, and finally: the encounter cards not coming with thematic intro text to describe the situation  and doing mostly the same thing.

adammale,10.0,"Scythe is the most anticipated game of the year 2016. Fun fact: scythe is used for both farming and war. Personally for me Scythe is an alternative to Terra Mystica, both are great games.

Mechanism and Heaviness:
It's basically an action-selection game with resource management and engine building. Solid mechanic. Multiple paths to victory. Very similar to The Gallerist, each turn you choose 1 out of 4 sections with 2 actions available. You can do the top-row action, or bottom-row action, or both (top-row first), or neither. In summary: move, produce, bolster power/ popularity, build structures, deploy mechs, upgrade & enlist recruits. There's no rounds or phases. It's medium heavy. It's thinky. If you like thinky Euro games like Terra Mystica, you'll like this game. Straightforward and intuitive gameplay. The depth of the game relies on the strategies players apply during the game. Almost no downtime, the turns can go very fast between players as resources are limited. Clear iconography.

Theme
It's alternate-history Eastern Europa circa 1920s. Building your small empire on the map. The factions, the miniatures and encounter cards gives more thematic feeling. The encounters provide more options to get more resources, and if you spend more time to read the flavor text on the encounter cards, you get to immerse yourself into the worldbuilding, similar like Arkham Horror game. Can be retheme as Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings if you want.

Components and Setup
The components are superb and top notch, so many different shapes of tokens, different types of cards, the character and mech miniatures looks great on the board! The setup feels very much like Terra Mystica with starting resources (military, combat cards, objective cards, popularity, money) and units + buildings on personal player boards. Wooden token management on the mats like in Terra Mystica and Eclipse. There are several decks like combat, encounter, objective (just need to complete one per game) and factory cards (extra action space, gained when visited The Factory for the 1st time). 

Factions and Replayability
Well-balanced asymmetry faction and mech abilities like in Terra Mystica. 3 out of 4 mech abilities are to improve mechs' and character's movement, while the other 1 is to improve combat. Variability created by random pairings of faction mat and player mat for each player. Terra Mystica base game has 14 different factions, with Fire and Ice expansion has another 6 factions (10 different coloured boards), Scythe base game has 5 faction boards and 5 player boards, with 25 different combinations. With the Invaders from Afar expansion, there's gonna be 49 combinations! The replayability is high. Different faction, different starting available terrains, different strategies. You've got to adapt to your surrounding.

Actions
TOP: move/ gain money (by moving, there can be combat/ encounter/ factory), bolster military power/ gain combat cards, trade resources/ gain popularity or produce on tiles (different tile different resource, resources stay on board with worker: wood, oil, metal, food or worker); BOTTOM (pay with resources): upgrade (move cube from top row to bottom row for discount), deploy mechs (special faction abilities), build structures (mine/ monument/ armory/ mill) or enlist recruits (1-time bonus and unlock action-reaction). Dual benefits of the upgrade system - increase top-row action benefit and decrease bottom-row action cost. Some small reminders: mechs share abilities with character, not workers, which include riverwalk; mech and workers can transport resources; mill is an extra territory for production; enlist ongoing bonus include activation from active player and immediate neighbours.

Combat
Threat of combat is constant, but not mandatory. Deterministic combat systemu sing power dial and combat cards like in Dune/ Rex (also Game of Thrones, Forbidden Stars, Cosmic Encounters). Add numbers on power dial (up to military power to spend) and numbers on combat cards (2 - 5, depend on number of units on tile except worker). The combat resolved fast, unlike those other games. Sometimes a game can be without combat. Each faction need only to win 2 combats to put 2 achievement stars on triumph track except the Saxony. Combat will lower attacker's popularity if there is any retreating workers from the opposition faction. There are no units/ structures destroyed, only retreating to home base.

Endgame
Endgame condition triggers when 1 player put 6 stars on the triumph track after fulfilling various requirements. The stars will come out very fast towards the end of the game. Unique endgame condition, very similar to console gaming with the achievement stars on triumph track. Most money win - popularity (love) reminiscent to Euphoria's morale track affect how much money collected for each stars, territories controlled (The Factory counts as 3 territories) and resources controlled. Plus random structure bonus scoring tile. 
  
Solo Variant - Automa
There are 4 levels of difficulty, Autometta for easy, Automa for normal, Automaszyna for hard and Ultimaszyna for hardcore. The Automa cards make the solo variant plays very smoothly. Mostly the Automa units would aim to reach The Factory. The solo variant is as good as The Gallerist's. 

Final Thoughts
Scythe is a keeper. Fans of Terra Mystica, The Gallerist, Eclipse and Game of Thrones will be at home with this game, with extra ability to play solo. Reputable designer of Viticulture and Euphoria fame. Watch Rodney's Watch It Played video before playing the game really helps you understand how the game flows. 

Expansion
The expansion with extra 2 factions is a must, the board just scream for epic 7-players game! With the base game, it's War of the Five Kings, with the expansion, it's gonna be Battle of the Seven Kingdoms! ",5,90,115,14,8.12311,1808,24971,en

LIKE: So many powers to explore, and a lot of different setup combinations. Having the two board combo was interesting. Beautiful art and highly produced bits. The war tension was fun and not overly threatening (except at the end). Very similar to Antike.

DISLIKE: In higher player counts, I felt the mid-game stalled and I became bored. Some player powers feel better than others. The encounter cards were boring. The player boards are fiddly. The theme did not add anything for me. Turn-order feels off, because ending the game early denies other equal turns.

OVERALL: This game plays very similar to Antike, but Antike plays faster and feels streamlined. Scythe does have its fun moments, but it also had moments where my turn didn't feel that interesting, so it would drag a little. I'd rather play Terra Mystica, or Viticulture-- Scythe relies too much on its theme to elevate it above the hordes of modern games.

Played again, and my thoughts are the same. Not sure why people like the game so much, but maybe the game is better with 4 players.",5,90,115,14,8.12311,1808,24971,en

ajie426,7.0,"超主观点评（4人局）：
1、可可爱爱的小动物们去合作拆弹，画风和主题都比较讨喜，游戏规则简单，玩的时间也不长（4人大概20分钟一局），我们连续玩了两把。
2、4人玩貌似没什么难度，在距离爆炸还有2格以上的时候全部成功了（玩了教学关的最后一关和正常的第一关）。
缺点：
小动物们如此可爱，能力怎么就都一样呢？
小心得：
1、1或者12多的玩家可以把2或者11标注一下，这样可以合理猜测最左边的是1，最右边的是12。
2、记住别人猜的数字，他猜过证明自己有。
玩法：
每人将自己的数字立牌由小到大放在自己面前，然后标记一个数字所在的位置给别的玩家看。到自己时，猜测一名队友的某一个立牌数字，如果猜对了，可以将自己的和队友的数字一起亮出来，如果有对应的策略卡，该策略则变成可用状态；如果猜错了，炸弹倒计时前进一格（错的次数多了会炸，猜了红色的数字也会炸），同时该队友要给出被猜数字的提示。所有数字都亮出来后游戏结束。",5,30,30,10,7.97553,373,2708,zh

It is just the right amount of complexity, we've only opened 2 boxes so far, but I like what the boxes do. They just give you a little more to consider without over complicating it.

Andy Parsons,7.0,"I'm not a huge fan of pure deduction games, but have played this one a fair bit (up to mission 10) and quite enjoyed it.  The task is to cut matching numbered blue wires and pairs of yellow ones, without snipping a red wire.  The difficulty is that you can only see the values, colours, and positions of your own wires.  You can also offer few clues as to what you have got.  Gradually, as more wires are cut and revealed, more can be deduced.  Early on in each round there is certainly a luck element in avoiding the red wire (instant failure).  In the box is a huge number of variations that add further bits and pieces and change the way the game is played.

Production quality is decent.  Although I'd have liked more solid racks for the wire tiles to stand in, the ones provided are serviceable.   The rules are fine.  The cute anthropomorphic bomb disposal team are very 2020s; don't worry children, bunny won't really get hurt if the nasty bomb goes off.",5,30,30,10,7.97553,373,2708,en

anim8r,9.3,"This game came out of the blue for me. The combination of no communication (safe to say, this is the only kind of co-op I will ever like) and deduction makes it so much fun—the best kind of deduction really! I have only played a dozen or so scenarios, but the games with 66 different ones with a ton of content hidden out-of-sight in boxes. Though it may seem like a legacy or campaign game…it’s actually a scenario-based game presented in a way to allow discovery, anticipation, and probably progression of difficulty. Nothing is stopping you from playing just mission #37 forever if you think that’s the best for you! This flexibility is a pretty awesome feature of this box packed with so much content. The deduction puzzle at the heart of this game is a blast—pun intended! It’s thematic, clever, and packed with surprises. Fun fact: I’ve only played this with people who (like me) hate co-op games… and everyone wanted more! That’s saying something.

Pain points: While the art is cute and charming and there is no shortage of content in this box…I do wish they had supplied better racks to hold the number tiles in this game. The racks are integral to the gameplay, and a little more design work on their shape so as to properly hold tiles on both sides or marked/numbered slots would actually make the gameplay smoother and help avoid mistakes. I have seen folks on BGG have designed 3D racks…just have to figure out how to get a set printed!

You must cut wires on your turn and making a mistake cutting means some info is released, but you're closer to the bomb going off. Unless you cut the red wire, then the bomb goes off immediately and you all lose.

There are 66 scenarios which appear to create many different, fun ways to experience the game. One of the biggest highlights of the game is how the tension ramps up as the game progresses. I actually expected it to subside, but it didn't.",5,30,30,10,7.97553,373,2708,en

BoardGameOmakase,8.0,"We've played Bomb Busters many times already but we still haven't opened the 6 different boxes that containing the 66 missions the game is packed with. 

We did open the first box because we were curious and was excited to see all the extra components to add to the game. We're not share we will ever finish all 66 missions, but the fact that it contains this much just in the base game feels like it's already worth the price of admission.

Bomb Busters is a cooperative deduction game that reminds us most of Hanabi. Players are members of a bomb disposal team, working silently together to identify the correct wires to cut. Essentially, you're deducing information that you have and what clues others have given to pair identical wires with theirs. The game itself is simple, but it difficulty ramps up immediately. 

We're not sure if we love Bomb Busters yet. It's thematic and rich with content, but it hasn't given us the highs of something like The Crew, where you feel extreme highs after passing the mission. Bomb Busters is more excruciatingly tense and more prone to cheating, especially since players have to point to a wire and it's so natural for others to give hints through their facial expression.",5,30,30,10,7.97553,373,2708,en

Die zwei Standardaktionen sind einfach: Entweder tippe ich bei einer Mitspielerin auf ein verdecktes Plättchen ihrer Bank und sage den zugehörigen Wert an. Stimmt dies, decken sie und ich analog das Drahtplättchen dazu auf. Stimmt es nicht, legt die Mitspielerin ein Hinweisplättchen vor sich mit dem entsprechenden Wert. Leider tickt dann aber auch die Bombe und nähert sich einem Schritt der Explosion. Pro Partie habe ich dabei nur Spieleranzahl minus 1 Fehlversuche, bis die Bombe explodiert. Bei gelben Drähten ist der Wert irrelevant, ich muss aber immer zwei gelbe Drähte durchschneiden. Und die roten Drähte darf ich niemals erwischen. Alternativ zum Duo-Schnitt kann ich einen Solo-Schnitt machen, wenn ich die restlichen zwei oder vier Plättchen eines blauen Wertes bzw. in der Farbe Gelb auf meiner Bank stehen habe. Denn dann gibt es niemanden mehr, der bei mir etwas mit diesem Wert durchschneiden könnte. Das Spiel endet, wenn die Bombe explodiert ist oder wenn wir alle Drähte durchgeschnitten haben.

Zu zweit gibt es die Besonderheit, dass jede Spielerin zwei Bänke vor sich hat und diese getrennt verwaltet. Das heißt, es werden zu Spielbeginn jeweils eine Anzahl Drahtplättchen pro Bank gezogen und auf beiden Bänken getrennt voneinander aufsteigend sortiert. Neben den acht Trainingsmissionen (inkl. Abschlussprüfung) gibt es einige Boxen mit bis zu 66 Missionen, die weitere Elemente ins Spiel bringen. Damit ist „Bomb Busters“ eher für Spielgruppen geeignet, die sich regelmäßig treffen, um ein Spiel gemeinsam durchzuspielen. Aber natürlich ist es möglich, auch quer einzusteigen. Zumindest die Grundregeln sind einfach zu merken. Zu diesen kommen später noch Ausrüstungsgegenstände und Charakterkarten mit Einmalfähigkeiten dazu. Vermutlich braucht man die auch irgendwann. Trainingsmission 3 konnten wir aber ganz stolz komplett ohne Unterstützung und ohne Fehlversuch absolvieren.

Mich hat „Bomb Busters“ sehr überrascht. Ich bin nicht so sehr der Deduktionsfan, weil ich recht schlecht in solchen Spielen bin. Die Aufgabenstellung ist hier aber genau auf meinem Niveau, sodass ich mich sehr wohl dabei fühle. Vor allem das laute Nachdenken macht Spaß, wenn ich meinem Gegenüber erkläre, was ich mir so denke, eine bestimmte Zahl zu nennen – und der dann nur die Augen rollt und den Explosionszähler eins vorrückt. Nicht immer ist die Wahl der Zahlen eindeutig und manchmal wird ein Schnitt mit einer 50:50-Chance durchgeführt. Diese Emotion und diese Spannung machen einfach sehr viel Spaß.

Da ich die Trainingsmissionen nur zu zweit gespielt habe, weiß ich nicht, wie es sich in einer größeren Gruppe mit bis zu fünf Spielerinnen anfühlt. Aber auch die Zweipersonenpartie hat mir gefallen. Vielleicht sogar ein bisschen mehr als die theoretische Mehrpersonenpartie, da ich bei manchen Entscheidungen mehr Informationen erlangen kann, da die Wahl der Bank oft auch eine Rolle spielt.

Mich hat „Bomb Busters“ dabei sehr an „Die Crew“ oder „The Gang“ erinnert, bei denen ich mich anfangs auch fragte, wie das überhaupt ohne weitere Kommunikation funktionieren soll. Nach dem ersten Fehlschlag bekommen aber meist alle ein Gespür dafür, wie die Kommunikation ohne Kommunikation funktioniert, und dann entsteht ein spannendes Spiel.

aaj94,6.0,"It's fitting that Everdell ends up right alongside Wingspan, as I think of them both in the same breath. Beautifully polished presentation, a warmed-over repackaged set of mechanics that aren't innovative but are frequently delightful. Sure, it doesn't do anything [i]new[/i], but is it such a bad thing to repackage old ideas in a new and lovely presentation? 

Tableau builders are right up my alley, and Everdell marries that with a feather-weight worker placement game, which gives it just that touch of extra interaction that I'm looking for (where [thing=266192][/thing] by contrast, is a more heads-down affair)

The first strategy step that Everdell grants you is figuring out the powerful green card effects. Because green cards fire up to four times during the game (if you play one first round), they can be very powerful resource generators for very cheap. Learning how to 'stretch' your engine far beyond your available workers is a key first step into Everdell strategy. 

After 15 plays, more depth has appeared. The deck is learnable, even though it's big, which unlocks deck churn, searching for powerful combos. Some of the 'undervalued' card draw actions now take on more value in our eyes, as we learn how those can get you the Ever Tree, or some equivalently powerful card. 

I think of Everdell as a perfect ""main course"" game that won't melt everyone's brains, nor repel the newbie gamers. It's a little bit too long at 5, but most games are. With 3, particularly, it shines with an under 90-minute play time.

Everdell doesn't have as much depth as [thing=68448][/thing], where there are a dozen good ways to win, but I don't hold that against the game. [thing=110327][/thing] happened to be the first game in this vein (in fact, LoW might have been one of the earliest 'polished' lightweight games that was marketed to a new incoming generation of gamers), but I prefer Everdell. Another similar game is [thing=270970][/thing], but it is much lighter, and uninteresting after a few plays. Consequently, Everdell has stuck in my collection where others didn't.

Again, for what it is, this is an excellent midweight game to keep in the collection. Like I mentioned above, [thing=266192][/thing] and [thing=231733][/thing] are both similar tableau builders, but different enough -- and tableau building being a mechanism that I enjoy enough -- that I don't think I will ever downsize any of the three.

Abdul,7.5,"I was tempted to buy this, based on the amazing art alone. After a couple of plays though, I found the tableau building too shallow and uninteresting. The combos depend too much on drawing specific card pairs that only work with each other, which made the gameplay too rigid. I generally prefer card games that give you more flexibility and multiple ways to use your cards. Still a pleasant game that I would be happy to play though. Don’t under estimate the appeal of cute animals.

EDIT: While it is still a bit simple for my tastes, it is always a pleasure to play. A solid gateway game with just enough decision making to keep a veteran engaged. The cardboard tree is worthless and gets more tattered with each assembly.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en

adamtay11,8.7,"[b]Taylor's 100-point rating:[/b]

[b]Enjoyment - 17/20[/b] - Everdell is one of the best games to try and get non-gamers into. It’s really fun and has a ton strategy, but is also really cute, beautiful and very thematic. Everdell is a game that I love, and everyone I’ve played with has loved it.

[b]Replayability - 14/15[/b] - This game has plenty of replayability, with new action locations being drawn every turn, different end game goals and just the luck of the cards you draw. Everdell seems to be a little different every game. I do think that there’s a small amount of room for improvement here, but not much.

[b]Game Mechanics - 12/15[/b] - Everdell has a very fun set of mechanics that aren’t all that unique to work placement games. Building your little town is very fun and rewarding, but having players play in different seasons can be a bit confusing. The helps a lot with gameflow and pacing. It’s fun to try and find cool card combos and invite critters to areas that are appealing to them.

[b]Theme/Artwork - 15/15[/b] - I know lots of people who play Everdell for the theme alone. The designers do such a good job of immersing you in this cute little forest with lots of different cute critters. The game is beautiful, and very immersive. They even have a big popup tree in the middle of your gameboard in case you forgot you’re in the forest!

[b]Gameflow/Pace - 7/10[/b] - Turns are quite fast, which keeps you from otherwise getting bored during other players’ turns. I also mentioned a little bit about playing through seasons and not having to wait for other players to finish each season, but there are games where some players will still be playing long since you finished and that can be boring, but doesn't always happen.

[b]Flexibility - 8/10[/b] - I wish you could play with more than 4 players, but the game plays really well anywhere between 1-4 characters. I appreciate this a lot as a frequent solo gamer.  

[b]Production - 5/5[/b] - The game pieces and cards are REALLY high quality. Even the little berries being so tactile and soft, while maintaining a good shape. Most board games get a 5 out of a 5, but this game goes above and beyond in this category that I seriously thought about giving it a 6.

[b]Effort To Play - 5/5[/b] - This game is a very quick setup, and I usually don’t have to try and convince anyone to pull this off that shelf. I can setup before hand or quickly after choosing the game.

[b]Accessibility - 4/5[/b] - For the most part, this game is pretty easy to get into and the rules are too complex. It’s not quite as easy as some other games, like Concordia, but the theme makes the game very inviting to new players.

[b]Total Score: 87/100[/b]

adamw,8.0,"Obviously the game is beautifully illustrated. And the components (of the deluxe copy only?) are very nicely done. The large tree is rather (well) large, but sets the tone for the game - fun in itself. So presentation, top notch. Game play - it is a combination card game which is normally something I do not enjoy. Here, however, because of the realized theme, I do enjoy it very much indeed. Looking forward to another play to improve my score.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en

adebisi,7.0,"Probably one of the cutest wolves in sheep’s clothing. Just by looking at components everything suggest that this is a mellow family game but the reality turned out something else. This is a really tight (one could even say brutally tight) engine builder. You are very limited in resources and actions and the only way to break these restraints is to build an engine to boost your resource production. However, this proved to be a rather difficult task to do, for the engines you are looking for largely depend on good card combos. The tricky thing here is that many cards in the game interact directly only with one other card in the deck, and hence you cannot be certain of establishing any kind of combos. At least I found myself scraping for whatever small advantages I could find for most of the first half of the game before I found anything resembling solid ground on which to build the foundations for my end game. And it was not only me who was struggling. My opponent who is an experienced player as well had a similar experience.
 
But the question - was it fun. I would say yes. The way the cards worked and interacted with other cards felt fresh and exciting. The theme and the art appealed to me at least. Playing time was reasonable. And the game offered a challenge for experienced players as well. My only concern is that some sessions may suffer from too big swings in the luck. If you just do not hit any combos while your opponents does, there really is no way to fight the wave, it will wash over you. If you can live with that, I could recommend Everdell.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en
adel9591,6.0,"Pretty art, but engine building is on the bland side and a little too tight for my taste (very limited number of workers). It's long for what it is, and I'd argue it's on the complex side given the limited number of things you can do. Lots of fluff, to summarize, but not a great design.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en

AdelinDumitru,10.0,"Update 9 August 2021: Updated my rating from 9.6 to 10. It's really one of my favorite games at the moment and one that I think about all the time when I'm not playing it.

As for the conclusion, luckily, the beauty of Everdell is captured by its gameplay. Meaningful decisions, fast setup, interesting combination of worker placement, hand management and card drafting, wonderful artwork, lovely theme, card variety and lots of replayability straight out of the box make for a very enjoyable game.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en

AdioRadley,7.0,"I'm normally not a fan of worker placement, but I didn't mind it too much in Everdell. The way cards paired together felt a bit swingy. Sometimes it was right there in front of you, sometimes you waited seasons and seasons for it to show up.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en
Aditceria,5.0,"The art is magnificent, but the downtime and the strategic decision of every move is not there for me, so that in the long game it will easily becomes boring.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en
adi_venturer,6.0,"I know this game is extremely popular, but it just didn't do it for me the one time I played it. 

I'll start off by saying that I LOVE how this game looks. The art is beautiful, and the pieces are very high quality. It has great table presence too (really cool looking tree!). The theme of the game is also right up my alley. I can also see how this game would be the pinnacle of tableau building for those looking to invest the time and energy.

Here's why Everdell didn't click for me:

1. The game isn't thematic, the theme is mostly painted on. I like the woodland critter theme but it doesn't tie into the mechanics at all. The tree serves no purpose in the game. It's a dry Euro at the end of the day.

2. You need to know all the cards to play this game well, which creates a high barrier to entry. I typically don't mind this as I prefer to invest lifestyle games. So for people who like this game, I can see how the game could be super satisfying as you build combos. For me, it was a bit too much to read the small printing on my cards (we were playing in a dimly lit bar), and also keep track of the text on everyone else's tableau. 

3. The season system is the biggest sin this game commits IMO. It makes it so that experienced Everdell players would stay in early seasons earning points, while less experienced players would end the game early and then just have to wait around (in our case for 60 minutes) for them to finish up. This is worse than player elimination, because you still have to stick around for end game scoring.

I might give this game another shot in the future, but it is unlikely I'll ever find the motivation to invest the time and effort this game demands, which I'd rather spend on campaign games or games I'm already invested in.

adwodon,7.0,"An interesting tableau builder that gets by mostly on its theme.  The core mechanic of getting a free critter if you have the matching construction is cute, but the deck is far too big to really rely on it, with very few ways of increasing card draw.

You can play from your hand or from a display of 8 cards which does help somewhat, but the cards in the collective pool can gum up real easy.

Feels like it should be a light and breezy game but somehow ends up taking 2-3 hours which this game absolutely does no warrant.

I have the complete collection, as my partner enjoys it, but the expansions make the already extemely obnoxious centre board even bigger.  Some of the expansions add some good mechanics but they bloat the playtime, making the game more crunchy which I just feel is not something this game should be doing.",4,40,80,10,8.00569,1422,21393,en
