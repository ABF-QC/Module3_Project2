1000rpm,8,"Rating based on one play. Seemed to only scratch the surface, at least I hope so. Seemed to be a big optimisation engine game. Unclear about balance, but we were all clueless."
12thManStanding,6,"I have had the opportunity to playtest this game in wave 3 and have played in 6 times in less than 2 weeks!  This game is fabulous, and definitely one of a kind.  The end game condition is similar to Euphoria where it ends on stars, but having the vp multiplier based on territories, stars and resources takes it up a notch. Not only do you have to be worried about the last star going out, but you also have to keep track of your popularity.  There is so much good to be said about this game, I enjoy it the most with 3 players and we were typically able to finish a game in under 75 minutes.  There are not very many games that pack so much punch in such a short time. Highly recommended!"

1point21gigawatts,7,"This looks a lot more complicated than it actually is. I like the simple actions, but there is a lot of strategy you have to take into account. Great game.  UPDATE 12-31-19: The first time I played this game, I loved it. It was very intuitive to learn and find a strategy, whether it was the right one or not. Easy 10 rating for me.  A few years went by and a handful more plays and I began to have doubts about my feelings for this game, and I eventually lowered it to an 8.  Now, 3.5 years after my first impression and 13 plays total, I’m dropping it to a 7. Very few games in our collection have I fell out of love like this after numerous plays (usually my enjoyment grows with more plays). I admire much of the design and mechanics of this game, but this isn’t really my jam. It’s time to be honest."

2dTones,6,"Very fluid and attractive game but after a few plays I don't have a burning desire to play it again. Although you get to make a good number of decisions for the playtime, I don't find many of them particularly interesting. Your overall strategy is mostly determined by the action board you get because the 2/3 coin bonuses are impossible to ignore. That being said, the end-game timing and scrambling for area control is very good."
2gunmojo,8,Really solid game.  Probably worth an 8 but with the hype it just didn't live up to the unreasonable expectations.  It did check the box of making us immediately want to replay it again.

35tango,9,"Scythe has long since had all of its hype come and go, and it still remains firm as a well loved game within the hobby.  I love the theme, the components, and just the overall style of game.  I feel like a lot of people expect Scythe to be a war game, and I think the game would be much worse if combat were more present.  I absolutely love the ""mutually assured destruction"" style that the game presents.  I adore this game.  While some of the expansions are a little disappointing, it is probably worth owning all of them."
383cherokee,10,"I have now played every faction. They all have a certain way to play each of them. That makes it fun to play with all the factions, you need to change your strategy for each of them. the ones that works for me are the Nordic and Rusviet factions. "
414448,7,"One play. Three players. Very involving and seemingly LOTS to explore.  Doesn't hurt that the game looks gorgeous and the map extension makes it wonderfully huge, and that the rules are rather simple and there's a great flow to the gameplay with short turns. It starts out simple and grows gradually more complex as the turns go by.  Edit: Grew from an 8 to a 9 after the second play. Wonderful!  Edit: started shrinking soon, and I got rid of it. What initially seemed so intriguing turned out to be fluff on top of a all too dry game."
4Corners,8,"A unique game that looks like Ameritrash but plays like a euro, set in a parallel universe where different nations are fighting for supremacy and/or busily doing their own thing producing goods, building etc (hence the term scythe and its dual purpose). The goal is to have the most money at the end of the game, and the end game is triggered by the player who first completes 6 conditions (signified by placing a star on the conditions).   You start the game with a leader of a nation who has a unique ability and a somewhat unique set of mechs (these are the advanced technological machines of war) as well as a random player board, each of which has the same actions, but the pairing of the top and bottom actions, as well as the costs/payouts of the bottom actions are each slightly different.  On your turn, you select one of the action columns, doing the top first, then the bottom (although you often won’t have the resources to pay for the bottom action), and you cannot do the same action column two turns in a row.   The top actions are: 1) gain power or combat cards (power is a currency that you can spend when in combat, and it’s also a star condition, and power cards are another currency that you can spend, more situationally, in combat), 2) movement (very important as you want to spread out on the shared map as there are several different regions for producing goods, there are random but good events that you can benefit from if you use your leader, and there is the central factory where you can gain a powerful extra action slot if you use your leader) or gain money (you can gain 1 or up 2 dollars (all basic abilities can be upgraded, more on that later), 3) produce (your workers will produce 1 good per worker on that hex, this is the main, but only, way to generate resources, as well as more workers (which is a start condition), but the drawback is the more workers you have producing, you get penalized each production (loss of power, money, popularity), 4) trade (pay 1 money for any 2 goods, a nice way to get those resources you really need but don't have access to), or popularity (pay 1 money for 1 (or 2 if upgraded) popularity- popularity is very important as its a star condition if you get high enough, but more importantly, it's a multiplier for your end game board position).  The bottom actions, which always cost resources, and generally pay out money after completing, are: 1) upgrade (a double benefit as you unlock/improve a top action ability, while decreasing the cost of a bottom action ability, and also a star condition for completing all upgrades), 2) construct a mech (you have 4 mechs, each with their own power that once built, applies to all of your plastic pieces (all your mechs and your leader), as well mechs and leaders can participate in combats), 2 of which if successfully won can get you stars, 3) build a building (each building has an ability, provides ownership of a hex, and is a star condition, and as well each game there is a bonus criteria for building certain patterns of buildings on the board), 4) enlist (you can receive a bonus each time you and/or your neighbor takes that particular bottom action for the rest of the game, also a star condition for completing all enlists).  The game end is immediately triggered once a player has achieved their 6th star; at this point endgame scoring provides money (to be added to the money you already have on hand, which could be significant) for each star you achieved, each hex you control (only your worker, leader, mech, and/or building on a hex), and each pair of resources you have left over (in descending order, as stars are more valuable than hexes etc); the caveat is that you get awarded coins based on your popularity, the more popularity, the better your endgame multiplier.  I was initially not interested in/dismissed this game, and as a result I missed the kickstarter.  Stupid me.  I ended up running around and eventually got everything, and I mean everything for the game.  I originally though it was pretty cool, then I thought it was too random, now with many more plays, I definitely appreciate the game and enjoy playing it.  Great components, art, design, lots of ways to play it, nice asymmetry, very fun.  This is one of my 10 year old's favourite games.  There are 3 major expansions, as well as some minor ones.  I think it's all worth getting, but the major expansions are excellent and must have, Invaders from Afar and especially Fenris are top notch.    Own the [boardgame=199727]Invaders From Afar[/boardgame],  [boardgame=223555] Wind Gambit[/boardgame],  [boardgame=242277]Rise of Fenris[/boardgame], [boardgame=262151]Encounters[/boardgame] and the [boardgame=279304]Modular Board[/boardgame] expansions."

A skinned math nerd,5,"A 5 might be a bit harsh, usually I'd give this game for the experience that I had a 6.  This rating isn't because of a devastating loss, I actually won my first and only play of it. But it became pretty clear that this game has a runaway leader problem, which probably has to be balanced out by the other players having to unite against the leading player. That the game manual requests that people refrain from actually keeping count of who is ahead in points and how many points are to be gained by an action doesn't help, it seems like it just wants to mask this issue. In our case, it was a little race at the beginning, but the game was pretty much decided after three or four turns, and this in part to the initial setup and the very first random encounter. After half of the game, we could have stopped, the outcome was clear and there was no possibility at all that I could see for the other player to get back into the game, without having done anything wrong himself when playing the game. The unbalanced secret goal cards probably added to this: While one of mine was a breeze to accomplish, both of the other player were rather hard to fulfill.  The game is definitely playable, as in: the game mechanics are working together, but they don't complement each other well enough. When looking under the hood, leaving all that bling (the opulent visuals of the game) behind, the mechanics seem to be tackered together so that there is just some variation and choice for a change of the game state when playing. Despite it seeming very complex at start and when looking at it on the table, there is actually very little ""game"" to be found in this one.  In hindsight, the game hints at being deep and immersive, but actually there isn't much to it. The only good thing about this is, it's actually quite easy to teach. If you want a game that is designed a lot better with a gameplay similar to this one, then I'd recommend to get Eclipse or Terra Mystica, for example. Skip this one instead."

aaj94,6,"What Scythe does, it does extremely well. This is a euro-game that has been optimized to its logical conclusion -- and I like it. All of the fiddliness of something like [thing=177736][/thing] or even Terra Mystica has been stripped away, and you're left with a very appetizing core.   I've enjoyed my plays so far, and would relish some additional time in this universe. Given time, Scythe could bump quite high up the list of my favorite euro-games, but I haven't played enough to draw that conclusion just yet."

aaron182,9,What a great game.  Great player powers and lots of ways to win and don't necessarily have to attack other players.  Great solo mode as well.  So fun and intuitive and gets easier with each play.  Iconography is easily understood.  So many good expansions as well especially the campaign.  Love it!
AaronCRdz,8,"The game that look as a war game, but isn´t about war! Great game to play with friends that are always looking a way to attack you! perfect to start everything as friend trying to get your cards your factory and then using your mechs to attack the others, so fun to play with good friends."
aaronph,9,"Great game, surprisingly quick to learn considering how complicated it seemed at the outset. The mechanics are rich and intuitive. Played with my friend who has a collector's edition.  I am jealous.  All 4 players enjoyed the experience and the end was close enough to come down to a tiebreaker."
AaronTargon,9,"This is not a mech combat game. It is a resource control euro. As long as you go into the game with that mindset, it will be fun."
Aaron_Dangerman,7,"How could you say no to the theme of 1920s Europe with giant robots?? The gorgeous art is also a major plus! However, I feel like it takes a long time to make those big-swinging moves. By the time you feel like you've made progress, the game is almost over."

ab999,9,"Excellent game.  Really enjoy it.  I play it a bit more tactically than strategically after less than 10 plays, but expect to ""graduate"" soon as I learn the different capabilities of the factions and player boards.  Looks more daunting than it is.  Rules fairly simple to remember and implement.  Your choices are a delicate balance. To me, it lives up to the hype."
abachniv,10,"All of the fun of a deep Euro-style game with none of the tediousness. Theme out the ass, every turn feeling valuable, and never a moment when anyone felt like they were potentially out of the game. Wonderful, wonderful. Lives up to all the hype and more."

Abdul,5,"Takes way too long for what it is. The first half is a slog as everyone is stuck in their corner of the map playing solitaire. The second half might have a little combat, but mostly involves players avoiding each other. Art is lovely, and I admire the attempt to make a Euro-Ameritrash hybrid, but I don't think it succeeds and just leaves me bored."

ablehat,7.5,"Wonderful action selection mechanism, big sprawling map, lots of paths to victory, slight optimisation mistakes that give you that rising sense of FOMO while everybody else is having their turn. Kind of a slog to teach, can make the first game quite a lot longer than advertised on the box. On repeat plays, I'm starting to see how thin the resource management is - if you push hard to place all of your mechs early game, iron will be meaningless to you until end-game scoring.  Certainly enjoyable to play, started off as being regular to hit the table, but doesn't maintain that quality."
ABrissey,9,"Excellent ""4X"" game, although the eXterminate is really missing from the game but that doesn't detract from the game in anyway. The euro game style economy and action resolution is perfect. Combat is quick and simple, but still contains a good level of strategy. Components are fantastic, especially the wonderfully sculpted mechs and characters. Art is spectacular and brings the whole thing together."
absolutleo,9,"Maybe the best game ever made, but I can't get it to the table as often as I like."

Abstractite,10,This could easily become my favorite game. Very few games have occupied my mind long after playing it---this did it like no other. I'm a big fan of strategic games that are relatively simple for the rich experience they provide. Scythe is special.
Absurdcleric0,9,"By far my most played game. Very fun and art is wonderful. Probably my favorite engine building game, it’s kind of the reverse of Root where Root is mostly area control with some engine building, Scyhte is more engine building and less area control. Over time, I’ve begun to appreciate Root more due to its greater asymmetry between factions, but I do enjoy Scythe still and will happily play it any time."

AbyssinianSon,9.5,I've only played the base game of this and I had heard a lot of hype going into it. Surely it couldn't be that good. For me..... it was. This game helped me discover what type of gamer I am as it balances a solitaire component with interacting without being too aggressive or stressful. In my game group its always hard to get people to play ultra confrontational games but this has been one of the few that everyone can always play.

Accatitippi,4,"My second play had me looking forward to the next game. That is, I was thinking: ""let this game end so that we can play something fun!"" It's balanced and works fine. Just severely lacking in the fun department. It's like they took Ameritrash, and took out the part about emerging epic storytelling and dramatic and memorable events. Then they took euros and took away the part about solving pressing problems in creative ways. Not sure about what is left to like."

ACEL13,8,"The artwork and figures are fantastic. The minis look even better when painted by a steady hand.  The one glaring flaw about this game is its fixed board state. It can get figured out in the same way you can figure out chess. Once you know what faction you are, you immediately know how you're going to win. The secret agendas and tech cards have very little impact in changing the game up.  Fortunately, a modular board was designed. It's not as variable as Catan or Twilight Imperium, but it does the job."

Achire,9,"9/25/20: A game I've enjoyed a great deal, although I'm now a little burned out on it. Highly recommend playing through the Fenris campaign. Enjoyed it greatly, but it did make me feel that I've 'completed' my Scythe experience. I'll likely return to it at a later date. 3/5/17: Plays very differently depending on the combination you get & maximizing your combo's potential is essential. I haven't played enough to know whether all combos are well-balanced. Fun, tense game that provides a variety of paths to victory. Beautiful design & components. Excellent streamlined engine-building gameplay. Things that keep it from being a ten: some fiddly rules that feel like they could have been streamlined, a little low on interaction for a game with combat, and finally: the encounter cards not coming with thematic intro text to describe the situation  and doing mostly the same thing. The encounter part could easily be fixed in a mini-expansion, and that alone would probably be enough to push it up to a 10."

adammale,10,"Scythe is the most anticipated game of the year 2016. Fun fact: scythe is used for both farming and war. Personally for me Scythe is an alternative to Terra Mystica, both are great games.  Mechanism and Heaviness: It's basically an action-selection game with resource management and engine building. Solid mechanic. Multiple paths to victory. Very similar to The Gallerist, each turn you choose 1 out of 4 sections with 2 actions available. You can do the top-row action, or bottom-row action, or both (top-row first), or neither. In summary: move, produce, bolster power/ popularity, build structures, deploy mechs, upgrade & enlist recruits. There's no rounds or phases. It's medium heavy. It's thinky. If you like thinky Euro games like Terra Mystica, you'll like this game. Straightforward and intuitive gameplay. The depth of the game relies on the strategies players apply during the game. Almost no downtime, the turns can go very fast between players as resources are limited. Clear iconography.  Theme It's alternate-history Eastern Europa circa 1920s. Building your small empire on the map. The factions, the miniatures and encounter cards gives more thematic feeling. The encounters provide more options to get more resources, and if you spend more time to read the flavor text on the encounter cards, you get to immerse yourself into the worldbuilding, similar like Arkham Horror game. Can be retheme as Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings if you want.  Components and Setup The components are superb and top notch, so many different shapes of tokens, different types of cards, the character and mech miniatures looks great on the board! The setup feels very much like Terra Mystica with starting resources (military, combat cards, objective cards, popularity, money) and units + buildings on personal player boards. Wooden token management on the mats like in Terra Mystica and Eclipse. There are several decks like combat, encounter, objective (just need to complete one per game) and factory cards (extra action space, gained when visited The Factory for the 1st time).   Factions and Replayability Well-balanced asymmetry faction and mech abilities like in Terra Mystica. 3 out of 4 mech abilities are to improve mechs' and character's movement, while the other 1 is to improve combat. Variability created by random pairings of faction mat and player mat for each player. Terra Mystica base game has 14 different factions, with Fire and Ice expansion has another 6 factions (10 different coloured boards), Scythe base game has 5 faction boards and 5 player boards, with 25 different combinations. With the Invaders from Afar expansion, there's gonna be 49 combinations! The replayability is high. Different faction, different starting available terrains, different strategies. You've got to adapt to your surrounding.  Actions TOP: move/ gain money (by moving, there can be combat/ encounter/ factory), bolster military power/ gain combat cards, trade resources/ gain popularity or produce on tiles (different tile different resource, resources stay on board with worker: wood, oil, metal, food or worker); BOTTOM (pay with resources): upgrade (move cube from top row to bottom row for discount), deploy mechs (special faction abilities), build structures (mine/ monument/ armory/ mill) or enlist recruits (1-time bonus and unlock action-reaction). Dual benefits of the upgrade system - increase top-row action benefit and decrease bottom-row action cost. Some small reminders: mechs share abilities with character, not workers, which include riverwalk; mech and workers can transport resources; mill is an extra territory for production; enlist ongoing bonus include activation from active player and immediate neighbours.  Combat Threat of combat is constant, but not mandatory. Deterministic combat systemu sing power dial and combat cards like in Dune/ Rex (also Game of Thrones, Forbidden Stars, Cosmic Encounters). Add numbers on power dial (up to military power to spend) and numbers on combat cards (2 - 5, depend on number of units on tile except worker). The combat resolved fast, unlike those other games. Sometimes a game can be without combat. Each faction need only to win 2 combats to put 2 achievement stars on triumph track except the Saxony. Combat will lower attacker's popularity if there is any retreating workers from the opposition faction. There are no units/ structures destroyed, only retreating to home base.  Endgame Endgame condition triggers when 1 player put 6 stars on the triumph track after fulfilling various requirements. The stars will come out very fast towards the end of the game. Unique endgame condition, very similar to console gaming with the achievement stars on triumph track. Most money win - popularity (love) reminiscent to Euphoria's morale track affect how much money collected for each stars, territories controlled (The Factory counts as 3 territories) and resources controlled. Plus random structure bonus scoring tile.     Solo Variant - Automa There are 4 levels of difficulty, Autometta for easy, Automa for normal, Automaszyna for hard and Ultimaszyna for hardcore. The Automa cards make the solo variant plays very smoothly. Mostly the Automa units would aim to reach The Factory. The solo variant is as good as The Gallerist's.   Final Thoughts Scythe is a keeper. Fans of Terra Mystica, The Gallerist, Eclipse and Game of Thrones will be at home with this game, with extra ability to play solo. Reputable designer of Viticulture and Euphoria fame. Watch Rodney's Watch It Played video before playing the game really helps you understand how the game flows.   Expansion The expansion with extra 2 factions is a must, the board just scream for epic 7-players game! With the base game, it's War of the Five Kings, with the expansion, it's gonna be Battle of the Seven Kingdoms! "
adammurgs,10,Includes Scythe Invaders from Afar Expansion 
adamredwoods,5,"3 plays / 5,6,7 players  LIKE: So many powers to explore, and a lot of different setup combinations. Having the two board combo was interesting. Beautiful art and highly produced bits. The war tension was fun and not overly threatening (except at the end). Very similar to Antike.  DISLIKE: In higher player counts, I felt the mid-game stalled and I became bored. Some player powers feel better than others. The encounter cards were boring. The player boards are fiddly. The theme did not add anything for me. Turn-order feels off, because ending the game early denies other equal turns.  OVERALL: This game plays very similar to Antike, but Antike plays faster and feels streamlined. Scythe does have its fun moments, but it also had moments where my turn didn't feel that interesting, so it would drag a little. I'd rather play Terra Mystica, or Viticulture-- Scythe relies too much on its theme to elevate it above the hordes of modern games.  Played again, and my thoughts are the same. Not sure why people like the game so much, but maybe the game is better with 4 players."

adamscott,9,"This game really lived up to the hype for me.  Sure the artwork is great and the theme integration is well done, but it is the gameplay that stood out.  It's definitely more of an efficiency Euro than a dudes on a map game, but I like having the option of attacking if necessary."
